PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.</h2></div>


<p><i>The Literary Shop</i> was first printed in
book form in the fall of 1894, nearly five
years ago. Some of its constituent papers
had already appeared in the pages of
<i>Truth</i> and <i>Puck</i>. To the present edition
have been added the sketches that
deal with life and letters in the McClure
village of Syndicate. This model literary
community was established about four
years ago, on a convenient and healthful
rise of ground overlooking the Hackensack River,
which is navigable at that
point. It has a population of several
hundred poets and prose hands, all of
whom are regularly employed on the
magazine and the newspaper syndicate
controlled by Mr. S. S. McClure. These
sketches are reprinted by permission from
the <i>New York Journal</i> and the <i>Criterion</i>.</p>

<small>IN AN OLD GARRET.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> lying at full length on a broken-down
haircloth sofa that has been placed
near the cobwebby window of an old garret
in a country farm-house. It is near
the close of a rainy day, and all the afternoon
I have listened to the pattering of
the heavy drops on the shingled roof,
the rustling of the slender locust-trees
and the creaking of their branches as the
wind moves them.</p>

<p>There are pop-corn ears drying on the
floor of this old garret; its solid rafters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
are festooned with dried apples and white
onions. Odd bits of furniture, and two
or three hair trunks bearing initials made
with brass-headed nails, are scattered
about the room, and from where I lie I
can see a Franklin stove, a pair of brass
andirons, and one of those queer wooden-wheeled
clocks that used to be made in
Connecticut years ago, and which are a
fitting monument to the ingenuity of the
Yankee race.</p>

<p>Every article in the room is carefully
treasured, and none is held in more tender
regard than are certain square, dust-covered
packages of what might be old
newspapers that are piled up in big heaps
beside the old chairs and tables. One of
these bundles lies on the floor beside my
sofa, with its string untied and its contents
scattered carelessly about. Look
down and you will see that it contains
copies of the <i>New York Ledger</i>, of a year
that was one of the early seventies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
which have been religiously preserved, together
with fully twoscore of other similar bundles,
by the excellent people who
dwell in the house.</p>

<p>The number which I hold in my hand
contains instalments of four serials, as
many complete stories, half a dozen
poems, contributions by Henry Ward
Beecher, James Parton, and Mary Kyle
Dallas, and a number of short editorials
and paragraphs, besides two solid nonpareil
columns of &#8220;Notices to Correspondents.&#8221;
One of the serials is called &#8220;The
Haunted Husband; or, Lady Chetwynde&#8217;s
Specter,&#8221; and deals exclusively with that
superior class of mortals who go to make
up what a great many of the old <i>Ledger</i>
readers would have called &#8220;carriage trade.&#8221;
Another story, &#8220;Unknown; or, The Mystery
of Raven Rocks,&#8221; bears the signature
of Mrs. E. D. N. Southworth, a name venerated
in every household in which a red-plush
photograph-album is treasured as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a precious <i>objet d&#8217;art</i>. The short stories
are simple and innocuous enough to suit
the most primitive of brain-cells. The
fiction is embellished with three pictures,
which are interesting as specimens of a
simple and now happily obsolete school
of art.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Notices to Correspondents&#8221; are
a joy forever, and reflect with charming
simplicity and candor the minds of the
thousands of anxious inquirers who were
wont to lay all their doubts and troubles
at Robert Bonner&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>It is here that the secrets of the maiden
heart are laid bare to the gaze of the
whole world. It is here that we read of
the young man who is &#8220;waiting on&#8221; a
young widow and formerly &#8220;kept company
with&#8221; a lady friend who is the cashier
of the laundry which he patronizes.
Not knowing which of the two he ought
to marry, he pours out his soul in this
free-for-all arena of thought and discussion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
&#8220;Mary X.&#8221; writes from Xenia, O.,
to inquire if she is a flirt because she has
a new beau every two weeks, and is solemnly
warned by Mr. Bonner that if she
goes on in that way she &#8220;will soon have
no beaux at all.&#8221; &#8220;L. L. D.&#8221; is a young
girl of eighteen, whose parents are addicted
to drink. She wishes to know if
it is proper for her to correspond with
a young gentleman friend who is a telegraph-operator
in Buffalo and has made
her a present of a backgammon-board
last Christmas. That these letters are
genuine is proved by their tone of artless
simplicity, and by the fact that no single
mind or score of minds could invent the
extraordinary questions that were propounded
from week to week.</p>

<p>Careful perusal of the <i>Ledger</i> lyrics reveals
a leaning on the part of the poets
of that period toward such homely themes
as &#8220;The Children&#8217;s Photographs,&#8221; &#8220;The
Mother&#8217;s Blessing,&#8221; and &#8220;Down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Old Orchard Wall.&#8221; They are all written
on the same plane of inanity, and are admirably
well suited to the tastes of the
admirers of Mrs. Southworth and Sylvanus
Cobb, Jr.</p>

<p>It is growing dark in the old garret&mdash;too
dark to read&mdash;and I arise from the
horsehair sofa, filled with memories of
the past which have been awakened by
perusal of the yellow sheet of twenty
years ago. As I tie up the bundle and
place it on the dust-covered heap with its
fellows, my eye falls upon a dozen packages,
different in shape from these and
containing copies of the <i>Century Magazine</i>
for the past decade, which are preserved
with the same tender care that was once
bestowed upon the <i>Ledger</i> alone.</p>

<p>But as I slowly descend the staircase
my mind is full of the favorite old story-paper,
and of the enormous influence
which its Scotch proprietor, Robert Bonner,
exerted over the literature of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
day and generation&mdash;an influence which
is still potent in the offices of the great
magazines which now supply us with reading
matter. I doubt if there has ever
been, in this country, a better edited
paper than the <i>Ledger</i> was in the days
when its destinies were shaped by the
hand of its canny proprietor. No editor
ever understood his audience better, or,
knowing his readers, was more successful
in giving them what they wanted, than
was Robert Bonner, whose dollars accumulated
in his own coffers even as the
files of his paper accumulated in country
garrets in all parts of this broad land.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where do you find evidences of
such careful editing in that hotch-potch
which you describe so carefully?&#8221; I hear
some carping critic ask, and as I run my
eye over what I have written I realize
that I have utterly failed in my attempt
to convey an idea of the glories of that
particular number of the <i>Ledger</i>. I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
say, however, to my critical friend that
the paper is well edited because it does
not contain a line of prose or a stanza of
verse that is not aimed directly at the
hearts and minds of the vast army of
farmers, midwives, gas-fitters&#8217; daughters,
and the blood-relations of janitors who
constituted its peculiar <i>clientèle</i>. And I
would add that if the critical one desires
to get at the very bone and sinew of
<i>Ledger</i> literature he should make a careful
study of the poems which were an important
feature of it, and in which may
be found the very essence of the great
principles by which the paper was guided.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Bonner used to be more
particular about his poetry than about
his prose, and always read himself every
line of verse submitted to him for publication.
Some of the poems were written
by women of simple, serious habits of
thought; but a great many of the highly
moral and instructive effusions that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
an important feature of the paper were
prepared by ungodly and happy-go-lucky
Bohemians, who were glad to eke out the
livelihood earned by reporting with an
occasional &#8220;tenner&#8221; from Mr. Bonner&#8217;s
treasury. These poets studied the great
editor&#8217;s peculiarities and personal tastes
as carefully as the most successful magazine
contributors of to-day study those
of the various Gilders, Johnsons, Burlingames,
and Aldens who dominate American
letters in the present year. For example,
no horses in <i>Ledger</i> poems were
ever permitted to trot faster than a mile
in eight minutes, and it was considered
sagacious to name them Dobbin or Old
Bess. Poems in praise of stepmothers or
life-insurance were supposed to be distasteful
to the great editor, but he was
believed to have an absolute passion for
lyrics which extolled the charm of country
life and the homely virtues of rural folk.
If a poet wrote more than one rhyme to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the quatrain he was warned by his fellows
not to ruin the common market.</p>

<p>And now I hear from the carping critic
again: &#8220;But you don&#8217;t mean to tell me
that any good poetry was produced by
such a process? Why, suppose one of
our great magazines&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said anything about good poetry?
It was good poetry for the <i>Ledger</i>
subscribers to read, and as to the great
modern magazines&mdash;haven&#8217;t I told you
already that I stumbled over a heap of
them just as I was leaving the old garret
where the pop-corn and the wreaths of
dried apples and the bundles of <i>Ledgers</i>
are kept?&#8221;</p>

<small>THE &#8220;LEDGER&#8221; PERIOD OF LETTERS.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A quarter</span> of a century hence, perhaps,
one of those arbiters of taste to
whom poetastry owes its very existence
will lecture before the intellectual and
artistic circles of that period on &#8220;The Literary
Remains of the Bonnerian Period&#8221;;
and the <i>Ledger</i> school of poetry, long
neglected by our critics, will become a
fashionable cult. I hope, too, that the
names of those writers who, as disciples
of that school, gave an impetus to those
great principles which live to-day in the
beautifully printed pages of our leading
periodicals will be rescued from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
shades of obscurity and accorded the
tardy credit that they have fairly won.</p>

<p>These principles have lived because they
were founded on good, sound, logical
common sense, for Mr. Bonner possesses
one of the most logical minds in the
world. In the days when he was&mdash;unconsciously,
I am sure&mdash;moulding the literature
of future generations of Americans,
he was always able to give a reason
for every one of his official acts; and I
doubt if as much can be said of all the
magazine editors of the present day. It
was this faculty that enabled his contributors
to learn so much of his likes and
dislikes, for if he rejected a manuscript
he was always ready to tell the author
exactly why the work was not suitable for
the <i>Ledger</i>.</p>

<p>For instance: One day a maker of
prose and verse received from the hands
of the great editor a story which he had
submitted to him the week before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&#8220;If you please,&#8221; said the poet, politely,
&#8220;I should like to know why you cannot
use my story, so that I may be guided in
the future by your preferences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Mr. Bonner. &#8220;This
story will not do for me because you have
in it the marriage of a man with his
cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested the young author,
&#8220;cousins do marry in real life very
often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In real life, yes,&#8221; cried the canny
Scotchman; &#8220;but not in the <i>New York
Ledger</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it is related of this talented young
maker of prose and verse, that he changed
his hero and heroine from cousins to
neighbors, and the very same night was
seen in Pfaff&#8217;s quaffing, smoking, and
jesting with his fellow-poets, and making
merry over the defeat that was turned
into a victory. And in the generous fashion
of Bohemia he told all his comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that &#8220;Bonner was down on cousins marrying&#8221;;
and thereafter neither in song
nor story did a <i>Ledger</i> hero ever look
with anything but the eye of brotherly
affection on any woman of even the most
remote consanguinity.</p>

<p>&#8220;In real life, yes; but not in the <i>New
York Ledger</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>That gives us a taste of the milk in
the cocoanut, although it does not account
for the hair on the outside of the
shell.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mr. Bonner knew
that a great many of his subscribers did
not approve of a man marrying his own
cousin when there were plenty of other
folks&#8217; cousins to be had for the asking;
and so, rather than cause a moment&#8217;s annoyance
to a single one of these, he forbade
the practice in the columns of his
paper.</p>

<p>I knew a number of these <i>Ledger</i> writers
in my salad days, and have often heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
them discussing their trade and the
condition of the market in a way that
would have lifted the hair of some of the
<i>littérateurs</i> of the modern &#8220;delightfully-Bohemian-studio-tea&#8221;
and kettledrum
school.</p>

<p>Years ago one of them confided to me
his recipe for a <i>Ledger</i> poem. &#8220;Whatever
you do,&#8221; he said, &#8220;be careful not to
use up a whole idea on a single poem, for
if you do you&#8217;ll never be able to make a
cent. I usually cut an idea into eight
pieces, like a pie, and write a poem for
each piece, though once or twice I have
made sixteen pieces out of one. My &#8216;Two
Brothers&#8217; idea yielded me just sixteen
poems, all accepted, for which I received
$160. What do I mean by cutting up
an idea? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. I took for
a whole idea two brothers brought up on
a farm in the country, one of whom goes
down to the city, while the other stays at
home on the farm. Well, I wrote eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
poems about those brothers, giving them
such names as Homespun Bill and
Fancy Jake, and the city man always
went broke, and was glad to get back to
the country again and find that Homespun
Bill had either paid the mortgage
on the place or saved the house from
burning, or done something else calculated
to commend him to the haymakers
who subscribed for the paper. Then I
wrote eight more, and in every one of
those it was the yokel who got left; that
is to say, Fancy Jake or Dashing Tom, or
whatever I might choose to call him,
would go to the city and either get rich
in Wall Street&mdash;always Wall, never Broad
or Nassau Street or Broadway, remember&mdash;and
come back just in time to stop the
sheriff&#8217;s sale and bid in the old homestead
for some unheard-of figure, or else
he would become a great physician and
return to save his native village at a time
of pestilence, or maybe I&#8217;d have him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
great preacher and come back and save
all their souls; anyway, I got eight more
poems out of the pair, to say nothing of
some stories that I used in another paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pondered for several moments over
the words of the poet and then I said to
him, &#8220;But if you were so successful with
the &#8216;Two Brothers&#8217; why didn&#8217;t you try to
do as well with two sisters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I started a &#8216;Two
Sisters&#8217; series as soon as the brothers were
all harvested, but I got them back on my
hands again. You know Bonner is down
on sisters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bonner is down on sisters!&#8221;</p>

<p>What stumbling-blocks there were in
the path to literary fame which the poets
of the early <i>Ledger</i> period sought to tread!</p>

<p>Fancy the feelings of one who has
poured out his whole soul in a poem descriptive
of sisterly love and learns that
his labor has been in vain, not because
of any fault on his part, not because his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
poem is not good, but simply and solely
because &#8220;Bonner is down on sisters&#8221;!
And then I hear the carping critic ask if
I call that good editing. I say that it
was the very best of editing. At any
rate, it was good enough to make the
<i>Ledger</i> fiction popular from one end of
this country to the other; and it is because
of that editing that we still find
the old dusty files in the country garrets,
along with the pop-corn ears and the
wreaths of dried apples. I wonder how
much of the ephemeral literature of to-day
will be found sacredly guarded in
anybody&#8217;s garret a quarter of a century
hence?</p>

<p>But there were other folks besides sisters
and matrimonial cousins who were
regarded with disfavor by the great editor
and thinker who long ago set the pace
for modern American fiction.</p>

<p>Well do I remember Jack Moran coming
upon us one bright morning, a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
years ago, with bitter invective on his
lips because his poem, &#8220;The Stepmother&#8217;s
Prayer,&#8221; had been returned to him from
the <i>Ledger</i> office. He read it aloud to
us, and then inquired, pathetically, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
that poem all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was more than &#8220;all right.&#8221; It was
a delicate, imaginative bit of verse, descriptive
of the young bride kneeling reverently
in the nursery of her new home
and praying that God would make her a
good mother to the sleeping stepchildren.
It was a real poem&mdash;such a poem as poor,
gifted Irish Jack Moran could write, but
only when the mood was upon him, for
he was not one of those makers of verse
who go to work at six in the morning
with their dinner-pails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Jack!&#8221; exclaimed a sympathizing
poet, &#8220;you never should have taken
it to the <i>Ledger</i>. Didn&#8217;t you know
that Bonner was down on stepmothers?
Change it round so as to make the stepmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
a beast, and he&#8217;ll give you ten
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Jack, do you remember
the time there was a death in the old
man&#8217;s family, and we all got in on him
with poems about meeting on the further
shore and crossing the dark river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Jack, briefly. &#8220;It was
worth just twenty to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And why was Bonner &#8220;down&#8221; on stepmothers?
Simply because he wished to
avoid giving offense to those who disapproved
of second marriages, and who
formed a very large part of his constituency.</p>

<p>I hope that I have thrown sufficient
pathos into my description of the condition
of the poor rhymester of a dozen or
fifteen years ago to touch the hearts of
my sympathetic readers. How much better
off, you say, is the literary man of to-day,
who makes steady wages in Franklin
Square, or occupies one of the neat white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
cottages erected for the employees of the
McClure Steam Syndicate Mills in Paterson!</p>

<p>Better off in some respects, perhaps,
dear reader, but in others his state is
none the more gracious than it was in
the days when Jack Moran&#8217;s &#8220;Stepmother&#8217;s
Prayer&#8221; was rejected because Bonner
was down on stepmothers. The great
<i>Ledger</i> editor has retired to his stock-farm,
but the principles which have enabled
him to possess a stock-farm still
live in every magazine office in the land,
and the writer of to-day must be just as
careful in regard to forbidden topics as
his predecessor was, and, moreover, must
keep his eye on three or four editors, with
their likes and their dislikes.</p>

<p>But these remarks are not made in a
carping spirit. There is some good reason
for every one of these likes and dislikes.
If Mr. Gilder prefers oatmeal to
wheaten grits as a breakfast-table dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for the hero of the new <i>Century</i> serial, it
is because he has an eye on his Scotch
subscribers; and if the manuscript of
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is returned to Mr. De Foe
with the remark that &#8220;Burlingame is
down on goats,&#8221; it is simply because
<i>Scribner&#8217;s Magazine</i> is not pushing its sale
in Harlem and Williamsburg.</p>

<p>In regard to the practice of cutting an
idea into eight pieces and serving up each
piece as a separate poem or story, can
any one familiar with current literature
deny that ideas are just as much cut up
now as they ever were? More than that,
have not some of our writers solved the
old problem of making bricks without
straw? Why, then, you ask, is their
manuscript printed in preference to matter
that is more virile and fresh and readable?
For the same reason that Jack
Moran&#8217;s &#8220;Stepmother&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; was returned
to him by the very hand that was
stretched forth in glad eagerness to grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the sixteen poems that had sprung from
the solitary idea of the two country brothers.
Why, I know of one or two poets
whose verses enjoy the widest sort of
publicity, and who, I am sure, cut an idea
into thirty-two pieces instead of sixteen.</p>

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT &#8220;GOOD BAD STUFF.&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Bonner</span> is down on stepmothers!&#8221;
&#8220;All <i>Ledger</i> horses must be called Dobbin,
and there is a heavy fine for driving
them through a poem or serial faster than
a walk, or, at best, a slow trot!&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t
write anything about cousins marrying
unless you want to have them back on
your hands again!&#8221; These were a few of
the beacon-lights that shone on the literary
pathway of twenty years ago, and I
know of more than one successful writer
whose early footsteps were guided by the
great artistic principles first laid down by
Robert Bonner and religiously followed
by the makers of prose and verse who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
brought their wares to him every Friday
morning. But poor Jack Moran did not
live to become a successful writer. He
dropped out of the ranks just as the rest
of us were passing the quarter-post, but
it was the first hurdle that really did
for him. I have often thought that if
Jack had taken his friend&#8217;s advice and
&#8220;changed his poem round so as to make
the stepmother a beast,&#8221; he might have
lived to fill a responsible position in the
Franklin Square Prose and Verse Foundry,
or at the Eagle Verse Works in Jersey
City. But Jack was a poet, and therefore
did not know how to &#8220;change his poem
round,&#8221; and besides he hated to go to
work every morning with his dinner-pail
in his hand, and there were cakes and
ale in Bohemia in those days for such
as he.</p>

<p>As for the poet who tried to guide
Jack&#8217;s footsteps in the path that led to
fame, he is alive to-day, and a highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
esteemed member of the guild. Indeed,
a more industrious, sober, or thrifty man
of letters never put on a pair of overalls
or crossed the North River in the early
morning boat with a basket of poems,
jokes, and stories on his arm.</p>

<p>One Friday morning, many years ago,
I went with this poet to the <i>Ledger</i> building,
and there found half a dozen writers
gathered together in an outer office,
anxiously watching the dark shadow of a
man that was thrown upon a partition
of ground glass that extended from floor
to ceiling across the room and separated it
from the private office of the great
editor.</p>

<p>The dark moving shadow on which
every eye was fixed was that of Robert
Bonner himself, and as it was seen to
cross the room to a remote corner&mdash;growing
smaller and fainter as it receded&mdash;every
face brightened with hope,
and forms that had seemed bent and dejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
but a moment before were suddenly
straightened. An instant later the
door opened and the editor of the <i>Ledger</i>
crossed the threshold, handed a ten-dollar
bill to one of the waiting poets, and then
hastily retired to his own den again.</p>

<p>Then my friend showed me how the
watchers could tell by the movements of
the dark shade whether a poem had been
accepted or refused. If the editor walked
from his desk to the remote corner of his
private office they knew that he did it in
order to place a poem in the drawer of
an old bureau in which he kept the accepted
manuscript; but if, on the other
hand, he came directly to the door a horrible
feeling of anxiety came into every
mind, and each poet uttered a silent
prayer&mdash;while his heart literally stood
still within him&mdash;that the blow might
fall on some head other than his own.</p>

<p>On this occasion my friend received
ten dollars for his poem entitled &#8220;When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the Baby Smiled,&#8221; and in the fullness of
his heart he invited the author of the
rejected verses on &#8220;Resignation&#8221;&mdash;who,
by the way, was uttering the most horrible
curses as he descended the staircase&mdash;to
join us in a drink.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion, also, as I distinctly
remember, that my friend the poet
put the whole trade of letters in a nutshell:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are plenty of people,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;who can write good good stuff,
but there are not many who can write
good bad stuff. Here&#8217;s one of those
&#8216;Two Brothers&#8217; poems I told you about,
and if that isn&#8217;t good bad stuff, I&#8217;d like
to know what is.&#8221; He handed me a
printed copy of the poem, and I can still
recall the first verses of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Herbert to the city went,</div>
<div class="indent">Though as sturdy was his arm</div>
<div class="verse">As plain Tom&#8217;s, who, quite content,</div>
<div class="indent">Stayed at home upon the farm.</div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Herbert wore a broadcloth coat,</div>
<div class="indent">Thomas wore the homespun gray;</div>
<div class="verse">Herbert on display did dote,</div>
<div class="indent">Thomas labored every day.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>These lines have clung to my memory
during many changing years, and I quote
them now with undimmed admiration as
almost the best example of &#8220;good bad
stuff&#8221; that our literature possesses. And
if the lines compel our regard, what must
be our respect for the genius which could
extract sixteen ten-dollar poems from the
one primitive idea of the two rustic brothers?</p>

<p>The bard who penned these deathless
stanzas has progressed with the times,
and now writes many a poem for the
<i>Century</i> and <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>, but I never see his
name in one of the great monthlies without
thinking of the days when he used
to sit in the outer office of the <i>Ledger</i>,
with half a dozen of his contemporaries,
wondering whether he would get a ten-dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
bill or his rejected poem when Mr.
Bonner came out to separate the chaff
from the wheat.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may wonder what
became of all the poetry that was rejected
by Mr. Bonner, and to these I would reply
that it was seldom, indeed, that any
literary matter&mdash;either in prose or in
verse&mdash;was allowed to go to waste. The
market was not as large then as it is
now, and a serious poem could &#8220;make
the rounds&#8221; in a very short time. If it
failed as a serious effort it was an easy
matter for a practical poet to add to it
what was called a &#8220;comic snapper,&#8221; by
virtue of which it could be offered to
<i>Puck</i> or <i>Wild Oats</i>.</p>

<p>For instance, a poet of my acquaintance
once told me that he wrote a poem
about &#8220;Thrifty Tom,&#8221; as he called him,
who insured his life for a large sum of
money, paid the premiums for two or
three years, and then died, leaving his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
wife and children comfortably provided
for. Now it happened that the great
Scotch editor did not believe in life-insurance
as an investment&mdash;the <i>Ledger</i>
published no advertisements of any description
in those days, so he was enabled
to view the matter with an unbiased mind&mdash;and
therefore he declined the verses,
not wishing to promote the interests of a
scheme which he could not indorse. And
straightway the poet sate himself down
and gave to his stanzas a comic snapper
which told how &#8220;Idle Bill&#8221; proceeded to
court and marry the widow, and passed
the remainder of his days in the enjoyment
of the money which the thrifty one
had struggled so hard to lay aside for his
family. In its new form the poem was
sold to <i>Puck</i>, and the word went out to
all the makers of prose and verse that
Bonner was &#8220;down on life-insurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is there any demand for &#8220;good bad
stuff&#8221; nowadays?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>There is an almost limitless demand
for it, and there always will be, provided
the gas-fitters and the paper-hangers and
the intelligent and highly cultivated
American women continue to exert the
influence in the field of letters that they
do to-day.</p>

<p>The &#8220;good bad stuff&#8221; of the present
era is printed on supercalendered paper,
and illustrated, in many instances, with
pictures that are so much better than the
text that it is difficult to comprehend how
even the simplest observer can fail to
notice the contrast. Moreover the good
bad stuff of to-day commands much
higher prices than were ever paid during
the <i>Ledger</i> period, and it is not infrequently
signed with some name which
has been made familiar to the public ear&mdash;if
only by mere force of constant reiteration&mdash;and
is therefore supposed to
possess a peculiar value of its own. Nevertheless
it is good bad stuff all the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and can be recognized as such by those
whose eyes are too strong to be blinded
by the glare from the pictures and the
great big literary name.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t understand me to say that there
is no good prose or verse to be found on
those highly glazed, beautifully printed
pages to which we of the present generation
of readers turn for our literary refreshment.
On the contrary, the modern
magazines give us so much that is admirable,
so many thoughtful essays and descriptive
articles, that one wonders only
why so much of the fiction which they
offer should be of such poor calibre.</p>

<p>But the editors and publishers of the
great monthlies know what they are
about as well as Mr. Bonner ever did,
and they know, too, the immense value of
the good bad stuff which they serve to
their patrons in such tempting and deceptive
forms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE EARLY HOLLAND PERIOD.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, near the close of the year 1870,
Dr. J. G. Holland started <i>Scribner&#8217;s Monthly</i>,
American letters entered upon a new
stage of its development. The literary
field was then occupied by the poets,
humorists, and essayists of the Pfaff
school, dwelling under the perpetual
shadow of the Bonnerian maxims, and
the occasional one of pecuniary depression;
also a few men of the James Parton
type who knew not Bohemia, and women
writers like Mrs. Dallas.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that at this
time no signatures were allowed in the
Harpers&#8217; publications, and the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
published in the <i>Monthly</i> was either of
foreign manufacture or else prepared in
the Franklin Square Foundry by poets
employed by the week at fair but not
exorbitant wages. The <i>Ledger</i> principles
were observed here to a certain extent,
but were not enforced as rigidly as they
were by Mr. Bonner in his own establishment.
I think, myself, that the Pfaff
poets were more directly accountable for
the introduction of the Bonnerian maxims
than were the Harpers themselves,
because they had become so accustomed
to eliminate stepmothers, sisters, fast trotters,
and other objectionable features
from their work that they had come to
regard them as quite as much outside the
pale of ordinary fiction as if they were
dwellers on the planet Mars. Moreover
a poem or story constructed on the Bonner
plan might, if rejected by the Harpers,
still prove acceptable to the <i>Ledger</i>.</p>

<p>From the very first Dr. Holland showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a commendable purpose to raise the tone
of the new <i>Monthly</i> above that of Mr.
Bonner&#8217;s story-paper, and although we
see distinct evidences, in his earlier numbers,
of <i>Ledger</i> influences, it was not long
before a gradual emancipation from the
strictest and most literal interpretation
of Mr. Bonner&#8217;s iron-clad rules began.
Horses soon began to strike a swifter
gait in the serial stories, and in &#8220;Wilfred
Cumbermede&#8221; one of these quadrupeds
has the hardihood to throw its rider over
its head. But that would never have
happened if George Macdonald had been
trained in the modern <i>Ledger</i> school of
fiction.</p>

<p>Looking over these old numbers in the
light of ripened knowledge, I can see Dr.
Holland slowly groping his way along an
untrodden pathway leading from the
<i>Ledger</i> office to the broad fields of literature,
where our magazine barons hold undisputed
sway. That he kept a watchful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
eye on his rural subscribers is shown by
an extended illustrated article on Fairmount
Park, and another one descriptive
of Philadelphia&mdash;subjects which possess
about as much interest for metropolitan
readers as that masterpiece of bucolic
romance, <i>The Opening of a Chestnut Burr</i>.
Among the writers whose names appear
in these numbers are Alice Cary, Edward
Eggleston, J. T. Headley, and Washington
Gladden&mdash;all graduates or disciples of
the great <i>Ledger</i> school.</p>

<p>Of these I consider Washington Gladden
entitled to the highest rank as an exponent
of mediocrity. Indeed, after a
careful survey of the magazine barons&#8217;
wide domain, I must award the palm of
merit to this popular manufacturer of
literary wares for even mediocrity, unspoiled
by the slightest sense of humor.
It is that very lack of humor which has
brought success to many a man whose
mission in life has been to write for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
great, simple-minded public. The poets
and humorists of the Jack Moran school,
who were compelled to descend to the
commonplace and the stupid because of
their temporal necessities, never really
became thorough masters of the divine
art of writing mediocrity, because their
sense of the ludicrous brought them to a
halt before those Alpine heights of tedious
imbecility which people like E. P. Roe
and Washington Gladden scaled with unblanched
cheeks.</p>

<p>But to return to Washington Gladden.
If any of the large and thoughtful circle
whom I have the honor to address have
never read a story from this gentleman&#8217;s
pen, entitled <i>The Christian League of Connecticut</i>,
I implore them to seek out the
numbers of the <i>Century</i> in which it appeared
about a decade ago, and sit down
to the enjoyment of one of the finest
specimens of unconscious humor that our
generation has known.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>This story deals with a league composed
of all the Protestant churches in a
small Connecticut town, for the promotion
of large-hearted geniality and mutual
aid in the work of evangelization. It
contains a description of a scene in the
Methodist Church at the moment when it
seems that the congregation will be unable
to raise the debt which has long
weighed them down. They are about to
abandon the attempt, when the other
churches in the town learn of their distress
and proceed to help them out. The
First Congregational Church pledges
$1675, the Universalist Church sends
$500, and finally the Second Congregational
Church raises the ante to $1810,
while the people burst forth into shouts
of &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; and fervent songs of
praise.</p>

<p>If any one were to write a wild burlesque
on the ecclesiastical methods in
vogue in Connecticut he would fall far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
short of Mr. Gladden&#8217;s account of this
extraordinary meeting. The New England
country parson who gets his salary
regularly is a fortunate man, and as to
subscriptions for the church, they are
usually collected with the aid of a stomach-pump.
I have never yet heard of a
man giving anything toward any church
save that in which he had a pew, but I do
remember the scene which ensued one
morning in a little country meeting-house,
when the richest man in the congregation
relaxed his grip on three hundred
dollars&mdash;and there was a string tied
to every bill, too.</p>

<p>Another chapter of <i>The Christian League</i>
tells us how Judge Beeswax returned to
his native village from the city in which
he had grown wealthy, and generously
gave a thousand dollars to save the old
church, in which he had worshiped as a
boy, from being sold for old timber.</p>

<p>And this <i>dénouement</i> bears such a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
resemblance to that in eight of
the sixteen &#8220;Two Brothers&#8221; poems that
I am half inclined to suspect that in his
younger days Mr. Gladden was one of the
poets who turned up at the <i>Ledger</i> office
every Friday and waited for the verdict.</p>

<p>And I am sure that Dr. Holland had
been, in his time, a close student of the
Bonnerian maxims, and especially of that
which I have already alluded to&mdash;&#8220;In
real life, yes; but not in the <i>New York
Ledger</i>!&#8221; To which might be added, &#8220;nor
in the old <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i> either.&#8221; All through
the Holland period we find evidences of
the deep hold that this maxim had taken
on the minds of both writers and barons.</p>

<p>For example, I believe that it is pretty
well known that extreme prohibition
measures bring about the most degrading
and terrible forms of drunkenness
known outside of Liverpool, and that of
all the prohibitory statutes the Maine
Liquor Law is about the worst. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the case in real life, but not in <i>Scribner&#8217;s
Monthly</i>, for in the year 1877&mdash;Dr. Holland
being then the dominant figure in
American letters&mdash;we find in an article
on the Rangeley Lakes the following
paragraph: &#8220;The Maine Liquor Law has
certainly put an end to this <i>régime</i> (a
barrel of rum to a barrel of beans), and
with it have disappeared to a very great
extent drunkenness, profanity, and kindred
vices.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, my carping friend, we all know
that the sentence which I have quoted is
ridiculously untrue, and entirely out of
place in a very interesting article on
trout-fishing, but there was just as good
a reason for printing it as there was for
publishing <i>The Christian League of Connecticut</i>.
That paragraph was well calculated
to please folks of the variety that
swooped down upon New York thirty
thousand strong, under the banner of the
Christian Endeavor Society.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>I do not know why it is, but people of
this class fairly revel in humbug of every
description, and nothing pleases them
more than to read about the beneficent
influences of prohibitory legislation, or to
swallow once more the old Anglo-Saxon
lie about Albion&#8217;s virtue and the wickedness
of France&mdash;and if you would like to
see that miserable fallacy whacked in the
head read Mr. Brownell&#8217;s <i>French Traits</i>&mdash;or
even to gloat over Mr. Gladden&#8217;s story
of the princely generosity that prevails
in the religious circles of New England.</p>

<p>These Christian Endeavor people are a
mystery to me. More than thirty thousand
of them took possession of our city,
and there was one erring brother among
them who fell by the wayside, and was
locked up in the House of Detention,
charged with having been robbed of his
return-ticket and about two hundred
dollars in money. He was confined
nearly a week, and during that time not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
one of his fellow Christian Endeavorers
held out a helping hand to him. If the
unfortunate man had come on from the
West to attend a convention of sneak-thieves
he would have fared better than
he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what have the Christian Endeavorers
to do with literature?&#8221; asks my
doubting and critical friend. They have
a great deal to do with literature just
now, more&#8217;s the pity. I did not drag
them into these pages by the neck and
ears simply to say what I thought of
them (although I am not sorry to do
that), but to give my audience an idea of
one of the elements&mdash;and it is a large
one, too&mdash;to which our magazine publishers
are obliged to cater, if they wish
to hold their own in point of circulation.</p>

<p>It is because of just such people as
these that our periodical literature is
constantly defaced by matter of the sort
that I have mentioned, and we are all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
time saying, just as Bonner said to the
Pfaff poet, &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing in real life,
but another in <i>Harper&#8217;s</i> and the <i>Century</i>.&#8221;
So it happens that intelligent human beings
must have their nostrils assailed with
rubbish about the Maine Liquor Law
putting a stop to profanity, because, forsooth,
it is supposed to tickle the palates
of a lot of sniveling humbugs, who are
so busy with prayers and psalm-singing
that they have not time to perform the
commonest acts of decency and charity
for one of their own kith and kin.</p>

<p>Understand me, I am not blaming the
barons for putting stuff of this sort into
their publications. If I were the proprietor
of a great magazine I would have a
picture of Robert Bonner over my desk,
and the walls of my editorial rooms and
business offices should be hung with the
great <i>Ledger</i> maxims. There are a thousand
mediocre people in this country to
where there are five of superior intelligence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
but, after all, the five have <i>some</i>
rights that magazine barons are bound
to respect, and I think that about Christmas-time
every year some little attention
ought to be shown them.</p>

<small>MENDACITY DURING THE HOLLAND PERIOD
OF LETTERS.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Holland age of letters may be said
to have extended over the eighth decade
of this century, and that it was an era of
change and progress can be readily seen
by a glance at the periodical literature of
the seventies.</p>

<p>It is during this era, however, that we
find indications of a deplorable tendency
on the part of the good doctor to pander
to the prejudices of the gas-fitter and the
paper-hanger element, by the publication
of stories and articles which were either
spurious as literature or else absolutely
mendacious as to the facts which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
recorded and the scenes which they described.</p>

<p>Of course I do not pretend that literary
mendacity began under Dr. Holland, for
the <i>Ledger</i> school was a highly imaginative
one, at best; but the vein of untruth
which is found cropping out from time to
time during the eighth decade has proved
infinitely more harmful to modern literature
than were the lurid and confessedly
improbable tales of bandits and haunted
castles and splendid foreign noblemen
which found so many eager readers a
score of years ago. The aristocratic circles
of English society which were enlivened
by the nebulous presence of Lady
Chetwynde&#8217;s spectre were so far removed
from those in which the spellbound hay-maker,
who read about them, had his being
that it made very little difference to
him&mdash;or to literary art either&mdash;whether
they were truthfully portrayed or not;
but the mendacious and meretricious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
literature which we find in the Holland
period is more pretentious in its imitation
of truth, and therefore all the more dangerous.</p>

<p>It was within a year after the first
number of <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i> had been issued that
Dr. Holland began the publication of a
series of papers, afterward printed in
book form, which deserve special mention
here because they are so thoroughly characteristic
of the period in which they saw
the light. They are known to the world
as <i>Back-log Studies</i>, and the average
reader of ordinary intelligence will tell
you that Mr. Warner&#8217;s book is &#8220;delightful
reading,&#8221; that he possesses a &#8220;dainty
style,&#8221; and that his studies of the open
fireplace are &#8220;fresh, original, and altogether
charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now did you ever happen to read <i>The
Reveries of a Bachelor</i>? If you did you
will admit that there was very little left
in an open fire when Ik Marvel got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
through with it; and if you have also
read <i>Back-log Studies</i> in the conscientious,
critical way in which all books should be
read, then you will agree with me in my
opinion that Mr. Warner found very little
to say about it that had not already been
much better said by Marvel.</p>

<p>The book is neither fresh nor original
nor charming, but it imitates those qualities
so artistically and successfully that
it has won for itself a unique place in the
literature of a period in which the <i>Ledger</i>
and the Holland schools of fiction may
be said to have struggled for the supremacy.</p>

<p>I do not call <i>Back-log Studies</i> mendacious.
They are merely imitative, and
deserve mention here only because they
were put together with so much cleverness
that nearly the whole of the reading
public has been deluded into believing
them wholly original and of a high order
of merit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>In a previous chapter I have cited certain
glaring examples of mendacity that
occurred during the Holland period; but
none of them deserves to rank, in point of
barefaced and unscrupulous perversion
of facts, with Abbott&#8217;s <i>Life of Napoleon
Bonaparte</i>, published in <i>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</i>
years before Dr. Holland became the leading
figure in American letters, which he
was during the seventies. Nor should we
lose sight of the fact that the present
literary age has given birth to no end of
stories and novels and descriptive articles
which are disgracefully mendacious in
color, fact, and sentiment.</p>

<p>But if you, my dear reader, would like
to see a descriptive article which is absolutely
matchless in point of mendacity
and asinine incompetency, turn to the
June <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i> of 1875&mdash;the very middle
of the Holland age&mdash;and read what a
certain Mr. Rhodes has to say about the
Latin Quarter of Paris. I suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
whole world does not contain a corner
that offers so much that is picturesque,
fascinating, interesting&mdash;in short, so well
worth writing about&mdash;as the Quartier
Latin in the French capital.</p>

<p>At the time this article was printed
there were dozens of clever young men&mdash;Bohemians,
poets, and humorists of the
class that used to gather in Pfaff&#8217;s of a
Saturday night to make merry with the
&#8220;tenner&#8221; received the day before for a
<i>Ledger</i> poem entitled &#8220;Going Home to
Mother&#8221; or &#8220;Be Prepared; Bow to the
Will Divine.&#8221; I doubt if we have to-day
young men better equipped for the task
of describing the student life of Paris
than were those who dwelt in our own
Bohemia in 1875. But the conductors of
<i>Scribner&#8217;s Monthly</i> passed them by and
intrusted the work to this Albert Rhodes,
concerning whom history is silent, but
who seems to have been more incompetent
and more unworthy of his great opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
than any human being on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>What shall we say of a man who quotes
one of the best things in the <i>Scènes de la
Vie de Bohême</i> and then blandly remarks
that he does not see anything funny in
it?</p>

<p>That is precisely what Mr. Rhodes
does. He prints the program of the soirée
given by Rodolphe and Marcel, and then
observes, with the solemnity of a Central
Park pelican: &#8220;There is nothing very
humorous in this, as will be observed, and
yet it may be regarded as one of the best
specimens of Murger&#8217;s <i>genre</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, I can inform Mr. Rhodes, and
also the simple-minded folk who believed
in him because he wrote for the magazines,
that if that chapter of the <i>Vie de
Bohême</i> is not funny, there is nothing
funny in the world. It begins with the
&#8220;opening of the salons and entry and
promenade of the witty authors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<i>Mountain in Labor</i>, a comedy rejected by
the Odéon Théâtre,&#8221; and closes with the
significant warning that &#8220;persons attempting
to read or recite poetry will be
cast into outer darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gifted Mr. Rhodes was probably
in doubt as to the humor of this passage
because it is not prefixed with &#8220;Our
friend K&mdash;&mdash; sends the &#8216;Drawer&#8217; the following
good one,&#8221; and because its point is
not indicated by italics after the fashion
of humor of the <i>Ayer&#8217;s Almanac</i> school;
but he can rest assured that that brief
quotation from Murger is the funniest
thing in his essay, always excepting his
own bovine lack of perception. It is
particularly funny to me because I have
sometimes witnessed the &#8220;entry and
promenade&#8221; through the salons of the
witty authors of stories that have been
accepted by magazines&mdash;a spectacle calculated
to produce prolonged and hilarious
merriment&mdash;and I have often wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
that the recitation clause in the Bohemian&#8217;s
program could be enforced in
every house in the town.</p>

<p>I have devoted a good deal of space to
this long-forgotten article because it is a
fair sample of the sort of stuff that is
offered to us from time to time, prepared
especially for us, like so much baby&#8217;s
food, by men and women who are carefully
selected by the magazine barons, and
who generally rival Mr. Rhodes in point
of simian incompetence and utter lack of
all appreciative or perceptive qualities.</p>

<p>But let us turn from the awful spectacle
of Mr. Rhodes standing like a lone
penguin in the very midst of the Latin
Quarter of Paris, and wailing mournfully
about the poor girl who &#8220;sometimes compels
the young man to marry her.&#8221; A
far brighter picture is that presented by
the distinguished English gentleman who,
having won the highest distinction with
his pencil, takes up his pen with the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of one who is enjoying a holiday fairly
earned by a lifetime of toil, and portrays
the real Quartier Latin of the Second Empire
with a humor that makes us think
of Henri Murger, and with a delicacy of
touch, a human sympathy, and a tendency
to turn aside and moralize that place him
very near to Thackeray.</p>

<p>If you wish to read a story which is at
once human, truthful, and interesting,
read George Du Maurier&#8217;s &#8220;Trilby,&#8221; and
note the skill with which he has caught
the very essence of the spirit of student
life, preserved it for a third of a century,
and then given it to us in all its freshness,
and with the fire of an artistic youth
blended with the philosophy and worldly
knowledge that belong only to later life.</p>

<p>To read &#8220;Trilby&#8221; is to open a box in
which some rare perfume has been kept
for thirty odd years, and to drink in the
fragrance that is as pervading and strong
and exquisite as ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>And while we are enjoying this charming
story, let us not forget to give thanks
to the Harpers for the courage which they
have shown in publishing it, for if there
is anything calculated to injure them in
the eyes of the gas-fitters and paper-hangers
it is a novel in which the truth
is told in the high-minded, cleanly, and
straightforward fashion in which Mr. Du
Maurier tells it here. Fancy the feelings
of a Christian Endeavorer&mdash;the modern
prototype of the Levite who passed by on
the other side&mdash;on finding in a publication
of the sort which he has always
found as soothing to his prejudices and
hypocrisy and pet meannesses as the purring
of a cat on a warm hearthstone&mdash;fancy
the feelings of such an one as he
finds the mantle of charity thrown over
the sins and weaknesses of the erring,
suffering, exquisitely human Latin Quarter
model.</p>

<p>One need not read more than a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
instalment of &#8220;Trilby&#8221; to realize that its
author never learned the trade of letters
in either the <i>Ledger</i> primary school or the
Dr. Holland academy, for there is scarcely
a chapter that does not fairly teem with
matter that has long been forbidden in all
well-regulated magazine offices, and I
know that a great many experienced
manufacturers of and dealers in serial
fiction believe that it marks a new era in
literature.</p>

<p>But to return to our sheep&mdash;and in
the case of Mr. Rhodes the word is an
apt one&mdash;why was that article about the
Latin Quarter of Paris published?</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers think it
was that the Scribner people did not know
any better, or because Mr. Rhodes belonged
to that &#8220;ring of favored contributors&#8221;
of which one hears so much in
certain artistic circles. In reply, let me
say that the &#8220;ring of favored contributors&#8221;
is a myth, or at least I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
been able to find reasonable proof of its
existence. Magazine editors buy exactly
what they consider suitable for their
readers, and they buy from whoever
offers what they want. If they allowed
themselves to be influenced by their small
personal likes and dislikes the whole literary
system which they have reared
would go to pieces, and some dialect-writers
that I wot of would be &#8220;back on
the old farm,&#8221; like the slick chaps in eight
of the &#8220;Two Brothers&#8221; poems.</p>

<p>As for the Scribner editors &#8220;not knowing
any better,&#8221; let none be deceived.
They have always known a great deal
more than their rejected contributors
gave them credit for, and there was a
distinct and vital reason for every important
step that they took in building
up the magnificent property now known
the world over as the <i>Century Magazine</i>.
Personally I have the highest confidence
in the wisdom of the magazine barons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
If a barbed-wire fence is stretched across
a certain pasture it is with a purpose
as definite and rational as that which
led Mr. Bonner to reject Jack Moran&#8217;s
&#8220;Stepmother&#8217;s Prayer&#8221; and pay $160
for the sixteen poems about the two
brothers.</p>

<p>No; there was something in this article
that made it valuable for magazine purposes.
It was well calculated to please
those who revel in that sniveling Anglo-Saxon
hypocrisy and humbug about
British virtue and the wickedness of the
French people. Mr. Rhodes was employed
by Dr. Holland because he was probably
the only living creature who could stand
on the spot from which has come so
much that has made the world brighter
and better and happier, and utter his silly
platitudes about &#8220;young men draining
the cup of pleasure to the dregs.&#8221; I say
that the editor of <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i> had just as
good a reason for publishing the Quartier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Latin essay as Mr. Bonner had for being
&#8220;down on stepmothers&#8221; and refusing all
poems that treated of them: <i>Dr. Holland
was down on grisettes</i>.</p>

<small>THE DAWN OF THE JOHNSONIAN PERIOD.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the good Dr. Holland passed
away, his mantle descended upon the
shoulders of Mr. R. U. Johnson, the foremost
of his disciples, and one who had
literally sat at the feet of the great master
of the eighth decade of the present century,
and learned from his lips the deathless
principles of modern magazine editing.
Since then Mr. Johnson has, in his
capacity of associate editor of the <i>Century
Magazine</i>, so skillfully blended the
methods of the canny Scotch <i>Ledger</i> editor
with those of Dr. Holland that he has
not only kept his own periodical well in
the lead, but has also set the pace for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
American literature and compelled his
rivals to watch his movements at all times
with the closest care, and frequently to
imitate him.</p>

<p>I first heard of the existence of Mr.
Johnson, who is unquestionably the one
dominant figure in American literature
of to-day, about fourteen years ago, just
as I was beginning to learn something
about the trade of writing. I had placed
in the hands of a literary friend&mdash;now
well known as one of the most successful
of the modern school of story-writers&mdash;the
manuscript of a story which dealt
with the criminal life of the lower east
side of the town, and was wondering how
soon I was to awake and find myself
famous when my manuscript was returned
to me with a brief note from my
friend, in which he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I read your story through yesterday,
and was so much pleased with it that my
first impulse was to take it to the <i>Century
Magazine</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> Indeed, I would have done so
had I not remembered at that moment that
Johnson does not like low life; so you
had better try one of the daily papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Johnson does not like low life!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>That was encouraging news for a young
man who believed that literary methods
had not materially altered since the days
when Oliver Goldsmith wrote <i>The Vicar
of Wakefield</i>.</p>

<p>The pen fell from my hand&mdash;it happened
to be employed just then on a
story dealing with life in a Pell Street
opium-joint&mdash;and I said to myself: &#8220;Merciful
heavens! must I devote my life to
the delineation of what are called society
types, simply because Johnson&mdash;whoever
he may be&mdash;does not like low life?&#8221;</p>

<p>I think that if I had known then that
low life was only one of a thousand things
that could not meet the approval of Johnson,
and that, moreover, Bonner was down
on fast horses, stepmothers, sisters, matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
cousins, and brindle-pups, I would
have thrown down my pen and endeavored
to support myself in some other
way.</p>

<p>But I did not know anything about
the practical side of literature then, so I
blundered on, wasting a great deal of
time over forbidden topics, until I made
the acquaintance of Jack Moran and
others of his school, who welcomed me to
Bohemia, and generously bade me share
their treasure-house of accrued knowledge
of editorial likes and dislikes. My
low-life story&mdash;in my sublime faith I had
written it on the flimsiest sort of paper&mdash;traveled
from one office to another until
it had eaten up $1.28 in postage and
looked like Prince Lorenzo in the last
act of <i>The Mascot</i>. Then, held together by
copper rivets, it sank into its grave in the
old daily <i>Truth</i>, unwept and unsigned.</p>

<p>I came across this forgotten offspring
of my literary youth not long ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
candor compels me to say that if Mr.
Johnson had read that story and printed
it in the <i>Century Magazine</i> he would not
be to-day the dominant figure in the literature
of our country that he is. My
romance was not nearly as good as a
great many that I have read in daily
papers from the pens of clever newspaper
men who know what they are writing
about. In point of intense dramatic interest
it was not within a thousand miles
of the <i>Sun&#8217;s</i> masterly history of the career
of George Howard, the bank burglar, who
was murdered in the Westchester woods
about fifteen years ago. The story of
Howard&#8217;s life and crimes was told in a
page of the <i>Sun</i>, I think by Mr. Amos
Cummings, and if I could find any fiction
equal to it in one of our magazines I
would gladly sound the praises of the
editor who was courageous enough to
publish it.</p>

<p>I can afford to smile now as I recall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the bitterness of spirit in which I used to
chafe under the restrictions imposed upon
us by the all-powerful barons of literature.
I used to console my wounded
vanity then by picturing to myself a
bright future, when Johnson would
stretch out his hands to me and beg me
to place on the tip of his parched tongue
a few pages of my cooling and invigorating
manuscript. And with what derision
would I have laughed then had any one
told me that in the years to come I would
be the one to accord to Mr. Johnson the
honor which is his just due, and to recognize
the wisdom which he showed in rejecting
my story of low life!</p>

<p>A truthful portrayal of life among the
criminal and vicious classes would be as
much out of place in the <i>Century Magazine</i>
as one depicting the love of a widower
for his own cousin, whom he took
out to ride behind a horse with a record
of 2.53, would have been in the old <i>Ledger</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and I am positive that such a thing will
not occur until after the close of the
present literary dynasty.</p>

<p>There is an excellent reason for this
prohibition, too. There are no people in
the world who have a greater horror of
what they consider &#8220;low&#8221; or &#8220;vulgar&#8221;
than those who are steeped in mediocrity,
and who, in this country, form a large
part of the reading public. In England
they are known as the &#8220;lower middle
classes,&#8221; and they exist in countless thousands;
but they have a literature of their
own&mdash;Ouida, the <i>Family Herald</i>, <i>Ally
Sloper&#8217;s &#8217;Alf &#8217;Oliday</i>,&mdash;and writers like
George Meredith and Mrs. Humphry
Ward and George Du Maurier pay no
attention to them or to their prejudices.
Nor does it seem to me that these writers
are as grievously hampered by consideration
for the peachy cheek of the British
young person as they claim to be.</p>

<p>The fact that Johnson was down on low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
life made a deep impression on me, not
so much because of what, I must admit, is
a most reasonable and proper prejudice,
but because I soon found that every literary
man of my acquaintance was fully
aware of his feelings in the matter, and
therefore took pains not to introduce into
a story any scenes or characters which
might serve to render the manuscript unsalable
in the eyes of the <i>Century</i> editors;
and as years rolled on I could not help
noticing the effect which this and other
likes and dislikes of this literary Gessler
had in moulding the fiction of our day and
generation. And it is because of this
<i>Century</i> taboo, which had its origin in the
<i>Ledger</i> office, by the way, that I know
of hardly a single magazine writer of to-day
who has made himself familiar with
the great wealth of varied material which
may be found in that section of New
York which it is the custom to refer to
vaguely as &#8220;the great east side.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>It was not very long after the receipt
of the letter which thrust upon my bewildered
senses a nebulous comprehension
of Mr. Johnson&#8217;s influence and importance
in the domain of letters that a
fuller recognition of his omniscience was
wrung from me, all-admiring, yet loath
to believe. Mr. H. C. Bunner had written
a story called &#8220;The Red Silk Handkerchief&#8221;
and sent it to the <i>Century</i> office for
approval. The story contained a graphic
description of the flagging of a train to
avert a disaster, in which occurred the
following passage:</p>

<p>&#8220;... and he stood by the platform
of the last car as the express stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a crowd around Horace in
an instant. His head was whirling; but,
in a dull way, he said what he had to say.
An officious passenger, who would have
explained it all to the conductor if the
conductor had waited, took the deliverer
in his arms&mdash;for the boy was near fainting&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
enlightened the passengers who
flocked around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horace hung in his embrace, too
deadly weak even to accept the offer of
one of dozen flasks that were thrust
at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now an ignorant layman will, I am
bound, find nothing in the quoted sentences
that could possibly give offence to
the most sensitive reader; but it was precisely
at the point where the quotation
ends that the finely trained and ever-alert
editorial sense of Mr. Johnson told him
of the danger that lurked in the author&#8217;s
apparently innocuous phrase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;can&#8217;t you
make it two or three flasks instead of a
dozen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well did the keen-witted Johnson
know that to many a serious minded gas-fitter
or hay-maker the spectacle of a
dozen evil-minded and evil-living men
riding roughshod through the pages of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
family periodical and over the feelings
of its readers would be distasteful in the
extreme, if not absolutely shocking. Two
or three flasks would lend to the scene a
delicate suggestion of the iniquity of the
world, just enough to make them thank
God that they were not as other men are;
but a dozen was altogether too much for
them, and Johnson was the man who
knew it.</p>

<p>It is only fair to add that the author
very properly refused to alter his manuscript,
and the story stands, to-day, as it
was originally written.</p>

<p>It was the flask episode that really
opened my eyes to the peculiar conditions
which encompassed the modern
trade of letters, clogging the feet of the
laborers thereof, and while making the
easy declivities about Parnassus accessible
to every one who could hold a pen,
rendering its upper heights more difficult
to reach than they ever were before. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
it was the same episode which finally
proved to me Mr. Johnson&#8217;s leadership in
contemporaneous literature&mdash;a leadership
which he has held from that day to
this by sheer force of his intimate knowledge
of the tastes, prejudices, and peculiarities
of the vast army of readers which
the <i>Century Magazine</i> has gathered unto
itself, and still holds by the closest of
ties, and will hold, in my opinion, so long
as Mr. Johnson remains at the helm, with
his pruning-hook in his hand, and reading,
with clear, searching eyes, the innermost
thoughts of his subscribers.</p>

<p>The present literary era has given us
many things to be thankful for, chief
among which should be mentioned the
enormous advance in the art of illustration&mdash;a
blessing which is shadowed only
by the regretful knowledge that literature
has not kept pace with her sister art. Indeed,
too high praise cannot be given to
the proprietors of the great monthlies for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the liberality and good taste which they
have shown in raising the pictorial standard
of their publications to its present
high plane, from which it commands the
admiration of all right-minded people.
And if we are living in the Johnsonian
age of letters we are also living in the
Frazeresque period of art, for I doubt if
any one man has exercised a wider influence
in the field of modern illustration
than Mr. W. L. Fraser, the maker of the
art department of the <i>Century</i>. Nor
should we forget his associate, Mr. Drake.</p>

<p>To the present literary era, we are indebted,
also, for the higher development
of that peculiar form of fiction called the
short story, the popularity of which has
at least served to give employment to
a large number of worthy people who
would otherwise have been compelled to
eke out an existence by humbler and
more exhausting forms of labor. No
sooner had the short-story fever taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
possession of the magazine offices than
there appeared from various corners of
the earth men, women, and children,
many of whom had never written anything
before in their lives, but who now
besieged the Franklin and Union Square
strongholds, bearing in their inky hands
manuscript which in many instances they
were fortunate enough to dispose of, to
the rage and wonder of those old-timers
who, having learned their trade under
Mr. Bonner and Dr. Holland, now found
themselves too old to readily fall in with
the new order of things.</p>

<p>Of this new brood a few were chosen,
and among them were the writers of dialect
stories, which enjoyed an astonishing
vogue for several years, and are now,
happily enough, losing ground. I think
the banner writer of dialect stories of this
period was a certain Mr. William McLellan,
who contributed a number of unique
specimens of his wares to <i>Harper&#8217;s Monthly</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
He could spell more words wrong
than any other writer I ever heard of and
I have often wished that I could read one
of his stories.</p>

<p>Some of these short-story marvels have
been extremely successful, and now take
rank as first-class writers of fiction. I
would have a much higher regard for
them, though, if they could write novels&mdash;not
serials, but novels.</p>

<p>Among other notable products of the
fecund Johnsonian age the future historian
of American literature will dwell upon
the <i>Century</i> war-papers, well calculated to
extend the circulation of the magazine
over vast areas in the South as well as
the North where it had been almost unknown
before; the Siberian experiences
of Mr. George Kennan; autobiographies
of celebrated men and women; and idyllic
phases of New England life from the pen
of the inimitable Mr. Gladden.</p>

<p>The Kennan articles were of enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
value, apart from their own intrinsic
merit, because their purpose was the reform
of certain abuses. We Americans
are so fond of reform that we are always
getting it in one shape or another, and
the more we get of it the more we want;
and these papers were aimed only at the
Czar of Russia and his advisers&mdash;men
who neither subscribe for nor advertise in
American monthlies. I doubt if a proposition
to undertake a crusade against
plumbers and compel them to lower their
prices would awaken a tidal wave of enthusiasm
in the <i>Century</i> office.</p>

<small>WOMAN&#8217;S INFLUENCE IN THE JOHNSONIAN
PERIOD.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems to me that so long as a literary
man can hold a pen in his hand there is no
danger of his going to the poorhouse; for
when he becomes too old to give satisfaction
as a reporter, or too prosy and stupid
to write essays on &#8220;The Probable Outcome
of the Briggs Controversy&#8221; for the
religious journals, he can always find a
purchaser for a series of <i>Letters to a Young
Man on the Threshold of Life</i>, and the sillier
the letters the greater will be their success.</p>

<p>I have read dozens of books of this sort,
and have often wondered at the uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
ignorance and stupidity which characterized
them. There was a time when I
wondered who bought these books, for no
young man on the threshold of life would
be seen reading one of them. I know now
that they are not written to suit the tastes
of the young men themselves, but of the
old grannies who will buy one at Christmas-time
as a present for Bob or Tom or
Bill.</p>

<p>They are compiled either by literary
hacks, enfeebled clergymen, or women of
limited intelligence, and they are artfully
designed to ensnare the fancy of the simple-minded,
the credulous, and the good.
I have noticed that those which are plentifully
supplied with texts from Holy Writ
command the largest sale, provided, of
course, the texts are printed in italics.</p>

<p>I believe that books of this description
belong to what is known technically as
the &#8220;awakening&#8221; class&mdash;that is to say,
they are supposed to awaken a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to a sense of his own spiritual degradation.
I cannot answer for their effect on very
young men, but I do know that they
awaken nothing in my heart but feelings
of uproarious hilarity; for I well remember
how the merry Bohemians who enriched
the literature of the <i>Ledger</i> age
with their contributions turned many an
honest dollar by means of these admonitory
letters, and not one of these priceless
essays but contained its solemn preachment
on the advantages to be derived
from the companionship of good, pure
women. But never a word was uttered
in regard to the bad influence of good
women.</p>

<p>Indeed, I can fancy nothing that would
have been less in harmony with a literary
spirit which denied recognition to stepmothers,
fast horses, and amatory cousins
than a vivid bit of realism of that sort;
and as for the succeeding age, was not the
good Dr. Holland himself the author of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the famous <i>Timothy Titcomb Papers</i>? It
is even too bald a bit of truth for the
more enlightened Johnsonian period in
which we live. Nevertheless the recording
angel has a heavy score rolled up
against the sex which it was once the
chivalrous fashion to liken to the clinging
vine, but which, as some of us know, can
clutch as well as cling&mdash;a sex which
continues to distil the most deadly and
enervating of intoxicants, the flattery of
tongue and eye, by the same process that
was known to Delilah and to Helen of
Troy.</p>

<p>But although the latter-day process of
distillation is undoubtedly the same that
was employed in centuries long gone by
the effects of the poison are by no means
the same now that they were then. In the
Homeric age it sent a man forth to do
valiant if unnecessary deeds; but in the
present era it slowly but surely robs the
young writer of his originality, undermines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
his reputation, nips all healthy
ambition in the bud, and leaves him a
stranded wreck of whom men say contemptuously
as they pass by: &#8220;Bad case
of the Swelled Head.&#8221; It may happen that
some more thoughtful of the passers-by
will have the grace to put the blame where
it belongs by adding: &#8220;That young fellow
was doing very well two years ago, and
we all thought he was going to amount to
something; but he fell in with a lot of
silly women who flattered him and told
him he was the greatest writer in the
world. They swelled his head so that he
could not write at all, and now he&#8217;s of no
use to himself or any one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>But although these poor stranded human
wrecks may be encountered in every
large community I have yet to find a
writer of advice to young men with sufficient
courage, veracity, and conscience to
utter a word of warning against the poison
to which so many owe their fall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>In order that I may make clear my
meaning in regard to the evil influences of
good women let us imagine the unheard-of
case of a young man who actually reads
one of these books of advice to young
men on life&#8217;s threshold, and is sufficiently
influenced by its teachings to seek the sort
of female companionship which he is told
will prove of such enduring benefit to
him. This young man, we will say, is beginning
his literary career in the very best
possible way, as a reporter on a great
morning newspaper. He is not a &#8220;journalist,&#8221;
nor a compiler of &#8220;special stories&#8221;
(which the city editor always takes special
pains to crowd out), nor is he &#8220;writing
brevier&#8221; or &#8220;doing syndicate work.&#8221; He
is just a plain reporter of the common or
garden kind; and very glad he is to be
one, too, for he and his fellows know that
the reporter wields the most influential
pen in America in the present year of
grace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>And every day this young man adds
some new experience to the store of
worldly knowledge which will be his sole
capital in the profession which he has
chosen. To-day the task of reporting the
strike at the thread-mills gives him an insight
into the condition of the working-classes
such as was never possessed by
the wiseacres who write so learnedly in
the great quarterlies about the relation of
labor to capital. To-morrow he will go
down the Bay to interview some incoming
foreign celebrity, and next week will find
him in a distant city reporting a great
criminal trial which engrosses the attention
of the whole country. He is working
hard and making a fair living, and,
best of all, he is making steady progress
every day in the profession of writing.</p>

<p>It is in the midst of this healthy, engrossing,
and instructive life that he
pauses to listen to the admonitory words
of the Rev. Dr. Stuffe:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>&#8220;Young man on life&#8217;s threshold, seek
the companionship of good women. Go
into the society of cultivated and thoughtful
people. You will be all the better for
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the young man arrays himself
in the finest attire at his command
and goes up-town to call on certain family
friends whom he has not seen for some
years past. Within a short time he finds
himself a regular frequenter of receptions,
kettledrums, and evening parties, with
dinners looming up on the horizon. He
meets a number of charming young
women, and cannot help noticing that
they prefer his society to that of the other
young men whom they know. These other
young men are richer, better dressed, and,
in many instances, better looking than our
young friend from Park Row, but what
does all that count for in the face of the
fact that he has often been behind the
scenes at the Metropolitan Opera-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and is personally acquainted with Ada
Rehan or Ellen Terry?</p>

<p>He thinks that Dr. Stuffe was right
when he advised him to go into society,
and already he feels sure that he is deriving
great benefit from it. But what he
mistakes for a healthful stimulant is, in
reality, the insidious poison against which
the Reverend Stuffe has never a word
of warning said; and, unless our young
friend be strong enough to flee from it in
time, he will find his feet straying from
the rugged path which leads to true literary
success, and which he has up to this
moment been treading bravely and with
ever-increasing self-confidence and knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you&#8217;re really a literary man!
How nice that must be! Do tell me what
<i>nom de plume</i> you write under!&#8221; some
lovely girl will say to him, and then he
will answer meekly that he does not sign
either his name or his <i>nom de plume</i>, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
he is working on a daily paper&mdash;if
he has a mind as strong as Daniel Webster&#8217;s
he will say that he is a reporter&mdash;and
then some of the light will fade out of
the young girl&#8217;s deep-blue eyes, and she
will say &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and perhaps ask him if he
doesn&#8217;t think Mr. Janvier&#8217;s story about the
dead Philadelphia cat the funniest thing
that he&#8217;s seen in a long while. Then she
will ask him compassionately why he does
not write for the magazines like that delightful
Mr. Inkhorn, who sometimes goes
down on the Bowery with two detectives,
and sits up as late as half-past eleven.
Has he read Mr. Inkhorn&#8217;s story, &#8220;Little
Willie: A Tale of Mush and Milk&#8221;? It&#8217;s
perfectly delightful, and shows such a
wonderful knowledge of New York!</p>

<p>At this point I would advise my young
friend from Park Row to put cotton in his
ears or turn the conversation into some
other channel, because if the sweet young
girl prattles on much longer he will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
that her literary standards of good and
bad are very different from those of his
editor-in-chief, whom he has been trying
so hard to please, and of the clever, hard-working
and hard-thinking young men
with whom he is associated in both
work and play. If she can inspire him
with a desire to please her, he will have
cause to bitterly regret the day that he
first sought her society in obedience to
the suggestion of Dr. Stuffe; for to accomplish
this he must put away the teachings
of his editor-in-chief, who has learned
four languages in order that he may understand
his own, and whose later years
have been devoted to the task of instilling
in the minds of his subordinates a fitting
reverence for the purity and splendor of
the Anglo-Saxon tongue.</p>

<p>It is precious little that the pure, refined
young girl cares about good English, and
she would be a rare one of her kind if she
did not prefer it splattered with hybrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
French because it &#8220;sounds better.&#8221; She
has a far higher regard for the author who
signs his name to &#8220;The Paper-hanger&#8217;s
Bride&#8221; in the <i>Century</i>, or &#8220;The Dish-washer&#8217;s
Farewell&#8221; in the <i>Ladies&#8217; Home
Journal</i>, than she has for the reporter who,
by sheer force of humor, pathos, and imagination,
has raised some trivial city happening
to the dignity of a column &#8220;story&#8221;
which becomes a three days&#8217; talk along
Park Row.</p>

<p>That there are women who habitually
judge literary matter strictly on its merits,
and without regard to the quality of the
paper on which it is printed, I will not
deny&mdash;I am even willing to admit that
there are women who will lead trumps at
whist&mdash;but I most solemnly affirm that
the average well-educated, clever reading
woman of to-day believes in her secret
heart that a magazine story possesses a
higher degree of merit than a newspaper
sketch <i>because</i> it appears in a magazine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and that the &#8220;literary man&#8221; who has succeeded
in selling enough short stories to
the monthlies to enable him to republish
them in book form has won for himself a
more imposing niche in the temple of fame
than should be accorded to the late Mr.
J. A. MacGahan, who was nothing but a
newspaper reporter to the time of his
death.</p>

<p>A few cases of Swelled Head resulting
from the flattery of women may be mentioned
here for the benefit of my imaginary
young friend from Park Row, to
whom they should serve as so many awful
examples of what may happen to one who
deserts the narrow and rugged path of
honest literary endeavor for the easy-going
drawing-rooms in which &#8220;faking&#8221; and
even literary and artistic theft are looked
upon with complacency and tolerance.</p>

<p>About fifteen years ago sundry poems,
essays, and short stories, bearing a signature
which is almost forgotten now, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to attract the attention of the critical, and
before long their author came to be looked
upon as one of the most promising and
talented young writers in the city. Unfortunately
for himself, however, his very
cleverness and its remarkable precocity
proved his ultimate ruin. He was a very
young man when he emerged from his
native commonplace obscurity and crept,
almost unaided, to the very edge of the
great white fierce light in whose rays the
most ordinary of folks become famous.</p>

<p>And, having reached the outer edge of
this brilliant disk of light, he leisurely sate
himself down to rest, firmly believing that
he was in the very center of it, and that
the silly flattery of underbred and half-educated
women, and some ridiculous puffery
at the hands of time-serving reviewers
and paragraphers, were the greenest bays
of Parnassus. He became thoroughly
satisfied with himself and with his work;
and the Swelled Head assumes no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
virulent or insidious form than that. He
did not become an unpleasant, egotistical
nuisance, as many people similarly afflicted
do. I cannot remember that he
talked very much about himself or his
work; he simply agreed with himself that
he was the greatest writer of the age, and
that he had already achieved fame and
glory of the highest sort.</p>

<p>That was not more than a dozen years
ago, and at that time his name was on
everybody&#8217;s lips as the &#8220;coming man&#8221; of
the period. Ah me! how many of these
&#8220;coming&#8221; men and women have come and
gone along the outer edge of the great
white light within my short memory!</p>

<p>In the past six years I have not seen
anything from his pen nor heard him
spoken of a dozen times. I saw him the
other night on Third Avenue, and if the
light from a huge sibilant electric lamp
had not shone upon him much more
vividly than the great white light of fame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
ever did, I would never have known him.
Seedy, abject, repulsive, he seemed fitted
for no rôle in life other than that of an
&#8220;awful example&#8221; to accompany one whose
profession it is to go about delivering lectures
on the evil results of indulgence in
Swelled Head.</p>

<p>In another case of Swelled Head which
has come under my observation, the victim
is a woman&mdash;rather an unusual thing, for
a woman&#8217;s vanity is not, as a rule, as
deep-seated as a man&#8217;s. This woman,
whom I will call Margaret Mealy, and
whose real name is well known to thousands
of magazine readers, dwells in a
pleasant inland town and has for a neighbor
an old-time friend and fellow-writer
named Henry Kornkrop. Both are graduates
of the old <i>Ledger</i> school&mdash;many a
Friday morning have they sat side by side
on the poets&#8217; bench in the outer office,
watching the awful shadow of Robert
Bonner moving to and fro behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
glass partition&mdash;and both have been successful,
though in widely different ways.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mealy has made the tastes of
mediocre people her life-study, and, as she
has never for a single moment lost sight
of the great literary principles which she
acquired during the period of her apprenticeship,
she has continued to keep herself
in touch with editorial likes and dislikes,
with the result that she is now a regular
contributor to the leading magazines, and
the author of various short stories and
serials of such incredible stupidity that I
often wonder what hypnotic or persuasive
powers made it possible for her to dispose
of them.</p>

<p>Her neighbor, Henry Kornkrop, is a
literary worker of another stamp. He
goes to work every morning at nine
o&#8217;clock, and from that hour until noon
the click of his type-writer does not cease
for a single instant. Two hours more in
the afternoon complete his day&#8217;s stint; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
as his contract with his publishers calls for
neither punctuation, paragraphs, nor capitals,
he is able to turn out a stupendous
quantity of fiction from one Christmas day
to another. He writes over the name of
&#8220;Lady Gwendoline Dunrivers,&#8221; and deals
exclusively with aristocratic life and character.
Many a young shop-girl going
down-town in an early elevated train with
the latest &#8220;Lady Gwendoline&#8221; in her hand
has been carried past Grand Street and
awakened with a start from her dream of
Lord Cecil, with his tawny mustache and
clear-blue eyes, to find herself at the Battery
terminus of the road. There is strong
meat in Henry Kornkrop&#8217;s work, and his
publishers gladly buy every ream that he
turns out. In one sense he leads an ideal
literary life, with no editors to refuse his
work or alter it to suit the tastes of their
readers, no vulgar publicity, no adverse
criticisms to wound his feelings, and, best
of all, no pecuniary care; for the &#8220;Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Gwendoline&#8221; romances bring him in not
less than $10,000 a year, which is probably
twice as much as Mrs. Mealy makes.</p>

<p>Of course neither of these writers turns
out any decent work the year through, if
we are to judge them by a respectable
literary standard; but it is not easy to determine
which of the two is the more culpable&mdash;Margaret
Mealy, who puts gas-fitters
to sleep, or Henry Kornkrop, who
keeps dish-washers awake. I fancy, however,
that there are few of my readers
who will disagree with me in my opinion
that, of the two, honest Henry Kornkrop
is by far the more successful and prosperous.
And yet Mrs. Mealy made up her
mind a few years ago that she really could
not afford to be on such familiar terms
with the Kornkrops&mdash;not that Mrs. K. was
not the very best of women, and Henry
the most industrious of men&mdash;but simply
because her position before the world as
a literary woman made it necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
her to be a little particular about her associates.</p>

<p>In other words, the silly flattery of
young women in search of autographs,
and of mendacious reviewers who have
manuscript to dispose of, has been sufficient
to upset the mental equilibrium of
this most excellent woman and leave her
a victim of the Swelled Head, pitied by
all who know her, and by none more than
by her old associate of the poets&#8217; bench,
Henry Kornkrop, the modest and gifted
author of the &#8220;Lady Gwendoline&#8221; romances.</p>

<p>One more instance of Swelled Head and
I am done. The case to which I refer is
that of Mr. E. F. Benson, the author of
<i>Dodo</i>, who has, I am credibly informed,
been so overwhelmed with attentions from
women of rank and fashion that his evenings
are now fully occupied with social
functions and he is unable to attend night-school.
This is to be regretted, for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Benson is by no means devoid of cleverness,
and I am sure that in an institution
of learning of the kind that I have named
he would soon master such mysteries of
syntax as the subjunctive mood, and at
the same time vastly improve his style by
constant study of such masterpieces of
simple, direct English as, &#8220;Ho! the ox
does go,&#8221; and &#8220;Lo! I do go up.&#8221;</p>

<small>LITERATURE&mdash;PAWED AND UNPAWED;
AND THE CROWN-PRINCE THEREOF.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;See</span> here!&#8221; cried a friend of mine the
other day, &#8220;you&#8217;re always crying down
the magazines, but I&#8217;ll bet you couldn&#8217;t
write a magazine story to save your
neck!&#8221;</p>

<p>My dear boy, I never said I could write
one&mdash;in fact, I am very sure I couldn&#8217;t;
it&#8217;s all I can do to read them after the
other people have written them. That is
an infirmity which has, I am sure, interfered
seriously with my labors as a critic&mdash;this
inability to wade through everything
that the magazine editors are kind
enough to set before us. But I contrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to keep in touch with contemporary fiction
by frequenting the Mercantile Library,
where I can not only read and write undisturbed,
but also take note of what
others are reading and writing. And toward
the close of each month I make it a
point to arrive very early of a morning
and take a superficial glance at the pages
of the different periodicals, in order to
gain an idea of the relative popularity of
each one, and of the stories which they
contain. When I find a story that is
smeared with the grime of innumerable
hands, or a magazine that has been
torn almost to shreds by scores of eager
readers, I retire to a corner and try to find
out the cause of all the trouble.</p>

<p>But this labor-saving system, excellent
as it is in many ways, has its defects; and
so it happened that I came very near
missing one of the most charming stories
that I have ever found in the pages of a
magazine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>One bleak autumnal morning not many
years ago I paid one of my periodical
early visits to the library, and had just
finished my examination of the literary
market when my eye happened to fall on
the name of François Coppée printed in
about the last place in the world that one
would be apt to look for it&mdash;namely, in
the table of contents of <i>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</i>.
It was signed to a story called &#8220;The
Rivals,&#8221; and although the pages of that
story were neither torn by nervous feminine
claws nor blackened by grimy hands
I began to read it, and as I read New York
slipped away from me, the wheezing of
the asthmatic patrons of the library became
inaudible to me, for I was in Paris
with the young poet and his two loves.
When I had finished the book I looked up
and saw that I was still in the library, for
there were the shelves full of what are
termed the &#8220;leading periodicals of the
day,&#8221; and two elderly ladies were racing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
across the room for the new number of
<i>Life</i>.</p>

<p>And then in the fullness of my heart I
gave thanks to the great firm of publishers
that had dared to violate all the sacred
traditions that have been handed down
from the Bonnerian to the Johnsonian
age of letters and print a story that could
make me forget for half an hour that I
had a thousand words of &#8220;humorous matter&#8221;
to write before twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>It was sad to come back from the <i>coulisses</i>
of the Vaudeville and find myself
directly opposite the shelf containing the
<i>Chautauquan Magazine</i> and within earshot
of the rustling of <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>;
but I turned to my work in a better spirit
because of M. Coppée and the Harpers,
and I have reason to believe that the
quality of the &#8220;humorous matter&#8221; which
I constructed that afternoon was superior
in fibre and durability to the ordinary
products of my hands. I know that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
dealer to whom I occasionally brought a
basketful of my wares gave me an order
the very next day to serve him once a
week regularly thereafter, and as he has
been a steady and prompt-paying customer
ever since I have special cause to
feel grateful to the famous house of Harper
for the literary stimulus which the
story gave me.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the fact that
the pages on which &#8220;The Rivals&#8221; was
printed were not torn and discolored like
those containing other much-read and
widely discussed romances. It was this
circumstance which led me to reflect on
the difficulties and discouragement which
confront the editor whose ambition it is
to give his subscribers fiction of the very
best literary quality. In this instance the
experiment had been fairly tried and yet
at the end of the month the virgin purity
of these pages was, to me at least, sadly
significant of the fact that Coppée&#8217;s delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
work had not met with the appreciation
which it deserved.</p>

<p>I did not, of course, lose sight of the fact
that the story appealed almost exclusively
to a class of people who keep their fingers
clean (and have cleanly minds also),
and that it was, therefore, not improbable
that it had found more readers than
the condition of its pages would indicate;
but nevertheless I was forced to the reluctant
admission that from a commercial
point of view the publication of &#8220;The
Rivals&#8221; had proved a failure; nor has the
opinion which I formed then been upset
by later observation and knowledge. All
of which served to heighten my admiration
for the enlightened policy which gave
this unusual bit of fiction to the American
public.</p>

<p>I said something of this sort to a friend
of mine, who, although rather given to
fault-finding, had to admit that the Harpers
had done a praiseworthy and courageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
thing in printing M. Coppée&#8217;s story.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said my friend, rather grudgingly,
&#8220;it was a big thing of Alden to buy that
story; but if that story had been offered
to them by an American they wouldn&#8217;t
have touched it with a forty-foot pole.&#8221;</p>

<p>My friend was quite right, for if that
story, or one like it, were offered in the
literary market by an American writer,
the editor to whom it was offered would
know at once that it had been stolen, and
would be perfectly justified in locking his
office door and calling for the police.
Coppée has simply told the story of a
young poet beloved of two women, a shop-girl
and an actress; and he has told it
truthfully as well as artistically&mdash;so truthfully,
in fact, that I shudder when I think
of the number of people of the &#8220;Christian
Endeavor&#8221; type who must have withdrawn
their names from the <i>Monthly&#8217;s</i>
subscription-list because of it. If I could
be assured that the number of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
wretched Philistines were far exceeded
by that of the intelligent men and women
who added their names because of this
important step in the direction of true art,
I would feel far more confident than I do
now of a bright near future for American
letters.</p>

<p>The very next day after that on which
I read &#8220;The Rivals&#8221; I was aroused by a
sudden agitation which spread through
the reading-room of the quiet library in
which I was at work. The table on which
my books and papers were spread shook
so that the thought of a possible earthquake
flashed across my startled mind,
and I looked up in time to see the young
woman opposite to me drop the tattered
remnants of <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>, from which
she had just deciphered an intricate pattern,
rush across the room, and pounce
upon a periodical which had just been
placed on its shelf by the librarian. If
she had been a second later the three other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
women who approached at the same moment
from three different parts of the
room would have fought for this paper
like ravening wolves.</p>

<p>The Christmas number of the <i>Ladies&#8217;
Home Journal</i> had arrived.</p>

<p>I do not know of any magazine which
so truthfully reflects the literary tendency
of the age as this extraordinary Philadelphia
publication, and I am not surprised
to learn, as I have on undisputed authority,
that it has a larger circulation than
any other journal of its class in this country.
It is conducted by that gifted literary
exploiter and brilliant romancer, Mr.
E. W. Bok, the legitimate successor to Mr.
Johnson, and the present crown-prince of
American letters.</p>

<p>I took the trouble to examine the number
which the librarian had removed, and
found that it had been pawed perfectly
black, while many of its pages were torn
and frayed in a way that indicated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they had found a host of eager readers.
Here was pawed literature with a vengeance,
and so, after leaving the library
that afternoon, I purchased a copy of the
Christmas number, thrust it under my
coat, and skulked home.</p>

<p>All that evening until well into the
early hours of the new day, I sat with that
marvelous literary production before me,
eagerly devouring every line of its contents,
and honestly admiring the number
of high-priced advertisements which met
my eye, and the high literary quality of
many of them. When I finally pushed
the Christmas number away and rose
from my table it was with a feeling of enthusiasm
tempered with awe for the many-sided
genius that controlled and had devised
this widely circulated and incomparable
journal. I must confess, also, to
a feeling of admiration tinged with envy
that took possession of my soul as I read
the serials to which were affixed the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of some of the most distinguished writers
in America. I have spoken in an earlier
chapter of the &#8220;good bad stuff&#8221; produced
by my friend the poet, and in which he
took such honest pride; and I would like
nothing better than to ask him his opinion
of the &#8220;bad bad stuff&#8221; which the acknowledged
leaders of our national school of
letters had unblushingly contributed, and
for which, as I have since learned, they
were paid wages that were commensurate
with their shame. Now the author who
writes a good story is entitled to his just
mead of praise, but what shall we say of
the author who succeeds in selling for a
large sum the serial that he wrote during
his sophomore year in college? I say,
and I am sure my friend the practical
poet will agree with me, that he ought to
be the president of an industrial life-insurance
company.</p>

<p>As for the literary huckster who succeeds
in distending the circulation of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
almost moribund weekly journal to unheard-of
limits by the infusion of this and
other equally bad bad stuff, I am at a loss
for terms that will do fitting tribute to
his ability, and must leave that duty for
some more comprehensive reviewer of a
future generation who will do full justice
to the genius of our great contemporary
in an exhaustive treatise on <i>English
Literature from Chaucer to Bok</i>.</p>

<p>Although as yet only the heir apparent
to the crown of letters, Mr. Bok has acquired
an undeniable and far-reaching influence
in the realm which he will one day
be called upon to govern, and has strongly
impressed his individuality on contemporaneous
literature, in which respect his
position is not unlike that of the Prince
of Wales in England. Among the more
noteworthy of the literary products which
have added lustre to the period of his
minority may be mentioned &#8220;Heart-to-Heart
Talks about Pillow-shams&#8221;; &#8220;Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
My Father Loved Muffins,&#8221; by Mamie
Dickens; &#8220;Where the Tidies Blow&#8221;; &#8220;The
Needs of a Canary,&#8221; by the Rev. Elijah
Gas; and &#8220;How I Blow My Nose,&#8221; by the
Countess of Aberdeen. Mr. Bok has also
made a strong bid for the favor of the sex
which is always gentle and fair by his
vigorous championship of what is termed
an &#8220;evening musicale,&#8221; an abomination
which still flourishes in spite of the persistent
and systematic efforts of strong,
brave men to suppress it. A timely Christmas
article on the subject, published about
a year ago, was found to be almost illegible
before it had been on the Mercantile
Library shelves a fortnight. This article
is by the wife of an eminent specialist in
nervous diseases&mdash;it may be that she has
an eye on her husband&#8217;s practice&mdash;and it
contains elaborate instructions as to the
best way of inflicting the evening musicale
on peaceful communities. How to entrap
the guests, what indigestibles to serve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
how to prevent the men from escaping
when the bass viol begins its deadly work,
and how to make them believe they have
had a pleasant time, are among the minutiæ
treated in this invaluable essay.</p>

<p>It is by sheer force of tireless industry
and a complete mastery of every detail of
his prodigious literary enterprise that Mr.
Bok has placed himself in the proud position
which he occupies to-day. He is the
acknowledged authority on such subjects
as the bringing up of young girls, the care
of infants, the cleansing of flannel garments,
and the crocheting of door-mats.
In the gentle art of tatting he has no superior,
and has long held the medal as the
champion light-weight tatter of America.
In his leisure moments he &#8220;chats with
Mrs. Burnett,&#8221; &#8220;spends evenings with
Mark Twain,&#8221; and interviews the clever
progeny of distinguished men in the interest
of his widely circulated monthly.</p>

<p>The homely qualities to which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
alluded in the preceding paragraph have
made Mr. Bok our crown-prince, but he
will live in history as the discoverer of a
new force in literary mechanics&mdash;a force
which may, with justice, be compared to
the sound-waves which have been the
mainspring of Mr. Edison&#8217;s inventions,
and one which is destined to produce
results so far-reaching and important that
the most acute literary observer is utterly
unable to make any estimate of them.</p>

<p>The use of the names of distinguished
men and women to lend interest to worthless
or uninteresting articles on topics of
current interest dates back to the most
remote period of the world&#8217;s history, but
it was Mr. Bok who discovered, during a
temporary depression in the celebrity
market, that a vast horde of their relations
were available for literary purposes,
and that there was not much greater
&#8220;pull&#8221; in the name of a citizen who had
won distinction in commerce, art, literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
in the pulpit or on the bench, than
there was in those of his wife, his aunt,
his sister, and his children even unto the
third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>It was this discovery that led to the
publication of the popular and apparently
endless series of essays bearing such titles
as &#8220;The Wives of Famous Pastors,&#8221;
&#8220;Bright Daughters of Well-known Men,&#8221;
&#8220;Proud Uncles of Promising Young Story-writers,&#8221;
and &#8220;Invalid Aunts of Daring
Athletes.&#8221; The masterpiece of these biographical
batches was the one bearing the
general head of &#8220;Faces We Seldom See,&#8221;
and it was this one which established beyond
all question or doubt the permanent
worth and importance of Mr. Bok&#8217;s discovery.
The faces of those whom we
often see have been described in the public
prints from time immemorial, but it
was the editor of the <i>Ladies&#8217; Home Journal</i>
who discovered the great commercial
value that lurked in the faces of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
women who were absolutely unknown
outside their own limited circles of
friends.</p>

<p>Then the relations of the celebrities became
writers on their own account, and
straightway the pages of Mr. Bok&#8217;s invaluable
magazine glistened with &#8220;How
My Wife&#8217;s Great-uncle Wrote &#8216;Rip Van
Winkle,&#8217;&#8221; by Peter Pointdexter; &#8220;My
Childhood in the White House,&#8221; by Ruth
McKee; &#8220;How Much Money My Uncle is
Worth,&#8221; by Cornelius Waldorf Astorbilt:
and &#8220;Recollections of R. B. Hayes,&#8221; by
his ox and his ass.</p>

<p>Even a well-trained mind becomes
stunned and bewildered in an attempt to
estimate the extent to which this newly
discovered force can be carried. The imagination
can no more grasp it than it can
grasp the idea of either space or eternity,
and it is my firm belief that under the impetus
already acquired in the <i>Ladies&#8217; Home
Journal</i> the hoofs of the relations of celebrities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
will go clattering down through the
literature of centuries as yet unborn.</p>

<p>In the mind of a celebrity the prospect
is one calculated to rob the grave of half
its repose; nevertheless it must be a comfort
to pass away in the great white light
of fame, cheered by the thought that the
stricken wife, the orphaned children, and
the consumptive aunt are left with a perpetual
source of income at their fingers&#8217;
ends.</p>

<p>A well-thumbed paragraph in a recent
number of the <i>Journal</i> announces that
Mr. Bok has trampled upon his diffident,
sensitive nature to the extent of permitting
&#8220;what he considers a very satisfactory
portrait&#8221; of himself to be offered to
his admirers at the low price of a quarter
of a dollar apiece. This offer, which bears
the significant heading &#8220;The Girl Who
Loves Art,&#8221; is made with the express stipulation
that intending purchasers shall
not deepen the blush on the gifted editor&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cheek by sending their orders direct to
the <i>Home Journal</i> office, but shall address
them direct to the photographer, Mr. C. M.
Gilbert, of 926 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I desire to add that I reprint this generous
proposition of my own free will and
without either solicitation on the part of
Mr. Bok or hope of reward from the photographer
whose precious privilege it has
been to transmit to the cabinet-sized cardboard
the likeness of America&#8217;s crown-prince.
I would not do this for Mr. Gilder,
for Mr. Scribner, or for any of the
Harpers. I would do it only for Mr.
E. W. Bok.</p>

certain breezy and intimate knowledge of
the men and events of the day which
fairly entitles him to a place of his own
in what ought to be the most enjoyable
of all circles of society. He is delighted
with the young women whom he meets
here in what his hostess fondly hopes will
become a <i>salon</i>&mdash;how many New York
women have had a similar ambition!&mdash;and
yet he cannot understand why they
pay so much attention to certain gentlemen
who are present also, and whom he
knows to be of very small account so far
as the arts and letters are concerned.</p>

<p>Young Daubleigh is there, the centre
of a breathless group, to whom he is bewailing
the utter lack of all true art sense
on the part of Americans, and the hideousness
of New York, which, he declares,
offers absolutely nothing to a true artist.
Daubleigh never goes into society without
a pocketful of art phrases, such as
&#8220;<i>au premier coup</i>,&#8221; &#8220;he has found his true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<i>métier</i>,&#8221; &#8220;the divine art of Velasquez,&#8221;
and others of the same sort. Of course
he is a great social favorite, and of course
he has very high ideals of his art, and is
apt to refer slightingly to artists who
know how to draw as &#8220;mere illustrators&#8221;&mdash;a
form of speech which does not
somehow endear him to those who know
that he ought to be at Cooper Union
learning the rudiments of his calling.</p>

<p>Another guest, and a favorite one too,
is the strangely gifted romancer who
poses as a literary man because he has
sold two sonnets and a short story to one
of the magazines, and of whom it is related
in an awestruck whisper that he
once went through Mulberry Bend, disguised
with green side-whiskers and under
the protection of a Central Office detective&mdash;all
this in search of what he calls
&#8220;local color.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our young friend from Park Row spent
two hours in Mulberry Bend the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
before in search of a &#8220;story&#8221; for his
paper, and has the hardihood to say so to
the charming young girl beside him, adding
that he felt as safe as if he had been
at an organ recital. The next moment
he realizes that he has made a mistake in
trying to destroy any of the glamour that
shines from the green whiskers and the
detective. The conversation now turns
upon the availability of New York as a
field for the writer of fiction, and is ably
sustained by a young gentleman who is
known to be &#8220;literary,&#8221; although no one
can say definitely what he has written.
However, he is literary enough to have a
place in this <i>salon</i>, and to take a leading
part in the discussions which go on there.
He is very decided in his views regarding
literature, as distinguished from what he
calls &#8220;mere newspaper scribbling,&#8221; and
does not scruple to express his contempt
for anything that is not printed either in
a magazine or &#8220;between covers,&#8221; as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
puts it in his careless, professional fashion.
Like many a one of the gentler sex, he
has been dazzled in early life by the glare
from the supercalendered paper. It is
now nearly two years since he first began
to be a literary man, and he regards the
progress that he has made during that
period as extremely gratifying, for he
has put himself on an excellent footing in
three or four of the most delightful literary
and artistic <i>salons</i> in the city, and
confidently expects to have a story published
in one of the leading monthlies by
midsummer. And that story will be published,
as I happen to know, as soon as
he has made certain alterations suggested
by the editor&mdash;taken out the strong scene
between the banker&#8217;s daughter and the
poor but impulsive suitor, and modified
various sentences which in their present
form might wound the susceptibilities of
a large contingent of subscribers.</p>

<p>This promising young writer has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
such a constant visitor to magazine offices
since he first embarked on a literary
career, and has associated so much with
the junior members of the editorial staffs
(or staves?), that his opinions are a reflex
of theirs, and he is now thoroughly in
accord with those with whom he is anxious
to do business.</p>

<p>Therefore when he remarks, in that
superior manner which insures for him
the instant credulity of the women in the
company, that it is not worth an author&#8217;s
while to study the social structure of New
York, he is right from his own point of
view, and it ill becomes our young friend
from Park Row to despise him for it.
And when he goes on to say that our beloved
city has no individuality of its own,
and is permeated through and through
with the awful flavor of commerce, while
its society is nothing but a plutocracy, I
would advise my young friend of the city
department to draw him out and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
careful notes of what he says about life
and literature.</p>

<p>This young man of letters is merely
echoing the opinions of those at whose
feet he has sat, humbly and reverently
acknowledging their literary supremacy,
and fondly hoping that they will purchase
his manuscript. He knows that Johnson
does not like low life, just as Jack Moran
knew that Bonner would not tolerate second
marriages or fast horses; and so far
as his own literary ambitions are concerned,
a thorough knowledge of New
York would prove about as useful to him
as a familiarity with the customs and beliefs
of the Mormons or the names of the
Derby winners would have been to the
old-time <i>Ledger</i> poets.</p>

<p>But the young reporter, who hears him
with feelings of either amusement or contempt
or indignation, as the case may be,
has already seen enough of New York&mdash;it
may be that he is able to compare it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with foreign capitals&mdash;to know that there
is an abundance of material within its
limits which native writers of fiction have
not only left untouched, but of whose
very existence most of them are absolutely
unaware. But it would be useless
for him to say so in this company, for he
who has just spoken so decisively is a
&#8220;literary man,&#8221; whose work will one day
be printed on the finest quality of paper
and perhaps adorned with beautiful pictures.
And besides, do not all the nice
people live north of Washington Square?</p>

<p>Ah! those nice people and that supercalendered
paper&mdash;what an influence
they exert in our literary Vanity Fair!</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the young literary men
will go on to say, in proof of his theory
about the literary poverty of New York,
that the magazines have already published
a great many articles and stories about
the Bowery and the east side, and have
in fact quite covered the field without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
enriching the literature of the day to any
very noticeable degree. All of which is
perfectly true, but the results might have
been different had the work been intrusted
in each case to a writer who was
familiar with the subject instead of to one
whose only qualification was that he had
mastered the art of writing matter suitable
for magazines&mdash;or, in other words,
&#8220;literature.&#8221; An exception to this rule,
and a notable one too, was made in the
case of Jacob A. Riis, who wrote some
articles for <i>Scribner&#8217;s Magazine</i> a few years
ago on the poor of New York, and who is
known as the author of <i>How the Other
Half Lives</i> and <i>The Children of the Poor</i>.
Mr. Riis knows his subject thoroughly&mdash;he
has been a police reporter for years&mdash;and
his contributions are valuable because
of the accuracy of the information
which they contain, which is more than
can be said of the work of some of the
wiseacres and gifted story-writers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
seem to stand so well in the estimation of
the magazine managers.</p>

<p>But, fortunately enough, the truth is
mighty, and must, in the long run, prevail,
in literature as in other forms of art:
and the enduring novel of New York will
be written, not by the man who, knowing
his audience of editors rather than his
subject, is content with a thin coating of
that literary varnish known as &#8220;local
color,&#8221; but by this very young man from
Park Row or Herald Square, to whom I
take the liberty of addressing a few words
of encouragement and advice. When
this young man sits down to write that
novel, it will be because he is so full of
his subject, so thoroughly in sympathy
with his characters&mdash;no matter whether
he takes them from an opium-joint in
Mott Street or a ball at Delmonico&#8217;s&mdash;and
so familiar with the various influences
which have shaped their destinies, that he
will set about his task with the firm conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
that he has a story to tell to the
world.</p>

<p>In that novel the &#8220;local color&#8221; will be
found in the blood and bones: it will not
be smeared over the outside surface with
a flannel rag. And men and women will
read the story and talk about it and think
about it, just as they are reading and
talking and thinking about &#8220;Trilby&#8221;
now.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear any one talk about
Mr. Du Maurier&#8217;s &#8220;local color&#8221;? I never
did.</p>

<p>But it was for the best of reasons that
the barbed-wire fence was stretched across
the city just below Cooper Union, although
it shut out from view a quarter of
the town in which may be found a greater
and more interesting variety of human
life and customs than in any other region
that I know of. Of course this literary
quarantine was not effected for the benefit
of men and women of clean, intelligent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
cultivated minds, but to avoid giving
offense to the half-educated and quarter-bred
folks whose dislike for what they
consider &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;vulgar&#8221; is only
equaled by their admiration of all that is
&#8220;genteel&#8221; and their impassioned interest
in the doings of &#8220;carriage company.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have sometimes accompanied parties
of sight-seers through what was to them
an entirely unknown territory, south of
the barbed-wire fence, and I have noticed
in almost every instance that it was only
the men and women of a high social and
intellectual grade who showed any true
interest in, or appreciation of, what they
saw there. There have been others in
these little expeditions who looked to me
as if they stood in perpetual fear of running
across some of their own relations,
and one of these once gravely assured me
that Hester Street was not at all &#8220;nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chinatown is to me a singularly attractive
spot, because of its vivid colors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
its theatre, joss-house, restaurants, and
opium-joints&mdash;those mysterious dens in
which the Occident and Orient are brought
into the closest companionship, while the
fumes of the burning &#8220;dope&#8221; cloy the
senses, and outcasts from every clime&mdash;the
Chinese highbinder jostling against
the Broadway confidence man&mdash;smoke
and drink side by side, talking the while
with a looseness of tongue that would be
impossible under any influence other than
that of opium. Mr. William Norr, a New
York reporter, has told us a great many
interesting and curious things about the
human types&mdash;Caucasian as well as Mongolian&mdash;to
be found in this quarter, and
his book, <i>Stories from Chinatown</i>, possesses
the rare merit of being absolutely true in
color, fact, and detail.</p>

<p>But there is something in this alien
settlement that seems to me to possess a
greater interest, a deeper significance, than
the garish lights of the colored lanterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
or the pungent smoke of the poppy-seed,
and that is the new hybrid race that is
growing to maturity in its streets and
tenements. There are scores of these little
half-breeds to be seen there, and one
of them has just come prominently before
the American public in the person of Mr.
George Appo, the son of a Chinese murderer
and an Irishwoman, and himself a
pickpocket, green-goods operator, as well
as one of the most entertaining and instructive
of all the witnesses examined
before the Lexow Committee.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Italians rub elbows in
this corner of the town, and a single step
will bring us into Mulberry Bend, bright
with red handkerchiefs and teeming with
the olive-skinned children of Italy. Nowhere
in the whole city is there a stronger
clan feeling than here&mdash;a feeling that
manifests itself not only in the craft and
ferocity of the vendetta, but also in a
spirit which impels these poverty-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
exiles to stand by one another in the hour
of trouble. There is no better-paying
property to be had than one of these Mulberry
Street tenements, for it is seldom,
indeed, that the Italian poor will permit
one of their number to be turned into the
street for want of a month&#8217;s rent.</p>

<p>The Jewish old-clothing quarter that
lies close to the Five Points is near by.
The &#8220;pullers-in,&#8221; as the sidewalk salesmen
are termed in the vernacular of the
trade, transact business with a ferocity
that can be best likened to that of Siberian
wolves; but over beyond Chatham
Square lies the Hebrew burying-ground,
an ancient patch of sacred soil which all
the money in New York could not buy
from the descendants of those whose ashes
repose there.</p>

<p>A few short blocks north of this old
landmark lies one of the most famous
political districts in the town, one which
is liable to become the pivotal point in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
exciting and closely contested election.
There is a saloon here on one of the side-streets
which it may be worth your while
to visit. It is a dark, uninviting place,
and its interior, with its rows of liquor
barrels and boxes and its throng of blear-eyed,
tough-looking customers, suggests
anything but wealth and power. Nevertheless
the taciturn little Irishman whose
name is over the door has grown rich here
and is the Warwick of the district so far
as the minor city offices are concerned.
And it was to this rumshop, as the whole
ward knows, that a President of the
United States came in his carriage one
Sunday morning not many years ago, to
make sure of the fealty of its proprietor
and pour the oil of patronage on the
troubled political waters.</p>

<p>And furthermore it is related of this
district boss&mdash;who stands in the same relation
to his constituents that the Roman
senator of old did to his clients&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
once at the close of an election day of
more than ordinary importance one of his
lieutenants burst in upon him, as he sat
with a few faithful henchmen in the back
room of his saloon, and announced triumphantly
that his candidate had carried
a certain election district by a vote of one
hundred and fifty-five to one. And at
this intelligence the east-side Warwick
swore a mighty oath, and, striking his
clenched fist fiercely on the table before
him, exclaimed: &#8220;What I want to know is
the name of the wan sucker that voted
agin us!&#8221;</p>

<p>And while you are strolling along the
Bowery you may come across an oldish-looking
man with a dyed or gray mustache
and a suggestion of former rakishness in
his seedy clothes and well-preserved silk
hat&mdash;a man who seems to have outlived
his calling, whatever it may have been,
and to have been left high and dry with
no intimate companionship save that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
his own thoughts. It will pay you to get
acquainted with this old man, for he belongs
to a race which is fast disappearing,
the race of old-time American gamblers,
of which Bret Harte&#8217;s John Oakhurst is
the best type to be found in our national
fiction. He still survives in the West
and South, but here in New York his
place has been taken by the new brood of
race-track plungers and Hebrew book-makers;
and the faro-box from which he
used to deal with deft fingers, and the
lookout chair from which he was wont in
the olden times to watch the progress of
the game with quick, searching eyes and
impassive face, know him no more.</p>

<p>If you are studying the different dialects
of the town, you should make careful
notes of this old man&#8217;s speech and of
the peculiar way in which he uses the
present tense in describing bygone happenings.
Mr. H. L. Wilson has given us,
in his excellent book of stories called <i>Zig-zag
Tales</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the following delicious bit of
dialect, which I quote because it well illustrates
what I have said. The words are
taken from the lips of the &#8220;lookout,&#8221; and
are addressed in a cautious undertone to
the faro-dealer:</p>

<p>&#8220;See his nobs there with the moniment
of azures? I&#8217;m bettin&#8217; chips to coppers
that&#8217;s Short-card Pete. He&#8217;s had his mustache
cut off, &#8217;n&#8217; he&#8217;s heavier &#8217;n he was
ten years ago. He tends bar in Noorleans,
in &#8217;68, fer Doc Nagle&mdash;ole Doc,
you rec&#8217;lect&mdash;&#8217;n&#8217; he works the boats a
spell after that. See &#8217;im one night play&#8217;n&#8217;
bank at Alf Hennesey&#8217;s, an&#8217; he pulls out
thirty-two solid thousan&#8217;; Slab McGarr
was dealin&#8217;, &#8217;nis duck here makes him
turn over the box. See &#8217;im &#8217;nother time
at San&#8217;tone, &#8217;na little geeser works a
sleeve holdout on &#8217;im&mdash;one a these here
ole-time tin businesses; you never see a
purtier gun play &#8217;n he makes&mdash;it goes,
too; mebbe it was n&#8217;swif&#8217;! He&#8217;s a-pullin&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
on that gang; get onto that chump shuffle,
will you? Ain&#8217;t that a play fer yer
life? He ain&#8217;t overlookin&#8217; any bets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you giving us?&#8221; is the contemptuous
cry of my young friend from
Park Row who has done me the honor to
read what I have written. &#8220;I know all
that about Chinatown and the politicians
as well as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>So you do, my young friend, and I
have no doubt you know it a great deal
better than I do; but I had a double motive
in offering you the words of suggestion
which you have taken the trouble to
follow. In the first place, when the young
literary man of limited achievement, referred
to in an earlier part of this chapter,
obtains an order for an article on
&#8220;The Coast of Chatham Square,&#8221; he will
probably come to you to find out where
Chatham Square is and at what time they
light the gas there: and I am sure you
will be glad to help him to the full extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of your knowledge, although you may
wonder why the order was given to him
instead of to you. In the second place,
although the whole of the east side is
familiar ground to you, there are plenty
of intelligent, well-informed men and
women who know very little about what
this city contains, and if you will read my
next chapter you will learn of the impression
which the tenement-house district
made upon a certain distinguished gentleman
who saw it recently for the first time.</p>

<small>&#8220;HE TRUN UP BOTE HANDS!&#8221;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> summer evening not very long
ago, I saw, to my intense surprise, Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder crawl cautiously
through the barbed-wire fence which was
long ago stretched, with his sanction,
across the city at Cooper Union. Once
within the tabooed district, the distinguished
poet and <i>Century</i> editor cast an
apprehensive glance about him and then
marched swiftly and resolutely down the
Bowery. Late that night I caught another
glimpse of him standing in the middle
of one of the side-streets that lead to
the East River, and gazing thoughtfully
at the tops of the tall tenement-houses on
either side of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>I could not help wondering what
strange errand had brought him to that
crowded quarter of the town, for not
many months before one of his own
trusted subordinates had blandly informed
me that there was nothing in New
York to write about, excepting, of course,
such phases of its social life as had been
portrayed, more or less truthfully and
vividly, in the pages of Mr. Gilder&#8217;s own
magazine.</p>

<p>I was still marveling at the spectacle
of the poet in search of facts when I came
across one of my east-side acquaintances,
who had seen and recognized the <i>Century</i>
editor, and from him I learned that he
was pursuing his studies of what is known
in the magazine offices as &#8220;low life,&#8221; not
that he might write about it or be capable
of judging the manuscript of those who
did write about it, but by virtue of his
office on the Tenement-house Commission.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s just been down Ludlow Street,
an&#8217; troo one o&#8217; dem houses where de Jew
sweaters is,&#8221; added my friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say to it all?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;He trun up bote hands!&#8221; said the
east-sider, earnestly.</p>

<p>I walked home that night weighed down
with the import of what I had learned,
and filled with solemn speculations regarding
the effect which Mr. Gilder&#8217;s visit
would have on American letters. I could
picture to myself the hands that would
be &#8220;trun up&#8221; in the <i>Century</i> office when
the accomplished members of the editorial
corps learned that their revered chief had
actually ventured into the heart of a district
which teems with an infinite variety
of human life and lies but a scant mile to
the south of the desk from which Mr.
Johnson rules the literary world of this
continent.</p>

<p>And I thought, also, of the excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that would run through the ranks of the
writers should Mr. Johnson, of course
after solemn and secret communion with
Mr. Gilder, announce officially that at
twelve o&#8217;clock, noon, on the first day of
the month, the firing of a gun, followed
by the destruction of the barbed-wire
fence, would throw open the long-forbidden
low-life territory to poets, romancers,
and dialectists of every degree. What a
rush of literary boomers there would be
to this new Oklahoma should this old barrier
be torn down! I could not help
smiling as I pictured to myself the
strangely gifted American story-writers
groping their way through picturesque
and unfamiliar scenes, and listening in
vain for the good old &#8220;bad man&#8217;s&#8221; dialect
that has done duty in fiction ever since
Thackeray visited this country, but which
was swept away long since by the great
flood-tide of German and Jewish immigration
which has wrought so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
changes in the life of the town. How
many ink-stained hands would be &#8220;trun
up&#8221; before the first day of exploration
was done! How many celebrated delineators
of New York life and character
would lose themselves in their search,
after dark, for &#8220;local color,&#8221; and be
gathered in like lost children to be cared
for by Matron Webb until rescued by
their friends the next morning!</p>

<p>Still brooding over the enormous possibilities
of the future, I stopped to rest
and refresh myself in a modest and respectable
little German beer-saloon, situated
on the tabooed side of the barbed-wire
fence&mdash;on the very border-land
between low life and legitimate literary
territory. It is an ordinary enough
little place, with a bar and tables in
front, and, in a space curtained off at
the rear, a good-sized room often used
for meetings and various forms of merrymaking.
I never drop in for a glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
beer without thinking of a supper given
in that back room a few years ago at
which I was a guest; and on this particular
night remembrance of that feast had
a new significance, for it was blended
with thoughts of Mr. Gilder&#8217;s journeyings.
It was an actor who gave the
supper&mdash;one of the most brilliant and
talented of the many foreign entertainers
who have visited our shores&mdash;and
nearly every one of his guests had won
some sort of artistic distinction. It
is not the sort of a place that suggests
luxurious feasting, but the supper which
the worthy German and his wife set before
us was, to me, a revelation of the
resources of their national cookery. The
occasion lingers in my memory, however,
chiefly by reason of the charm and tact
and brilliancy of the woman who sat in
the place of honor&mdash;a woman whose
name rang through Europe more than a
quarter of a century ago as that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
heroine of one of the most sensational
duels of modern times. Mr. Gilder has
probably read about her in <i>The Tragic
Comedians</i>, in which George Meredith
has made her the principal character,
and I am sure that if he&mdash;the <i>Century</i>
editor, not Mr. Meredith&mdash;had looked in
upon our little supper party that night,
he would have &#8220;trun up bote hands,&#8221; in
the full sense of that unique and expressive
term.</p>

<p>Recollections of this feast brought to
mind another which was given about
two years ago fully half a mile to the
south of the barbed-wire fence, and
which is worthy of mention here because
it taught me that some of the people
bred in that region are vaguely conscious
of a just claim that they have on the attention
of story-writers and rather resent
the fact that a place in our national
literature has been denied them.</p>

<p>The feast to which I allude was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on the occasion of a great wedding in a
quarter of the town which plays an important
part in civic and national affairs
on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&mdash;one in which the
trade of politics ranks as one of the
learned professions&mdash;a quarter where
events date from the reigns of the different
police captains.</p>

<p>The bride was the daughter of a famous
politician, and I am sure that in
point of beauty and tasteful dress she
might have passed muster at Tuxedo.
She was tall, graceful, and very young&mdash;not
more than seventeen. One could see
traces of her Hebrew lineage in her exquisitely
lovely face, and I am sure she
was well dressed, because she wore nothing
that in any way detracted from her
rare beauty or was offensive to the eye.</p>

<p>She had been brought up near the corner
of the Bowery and Hester Street, in
the very centre of one of the most vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and depraved quarters of the town;
and as I talked with her that night she
told me how most of her childhood had
been spent playing with her little brothers
and sisters in the garden which her
father had built for them on the roof of
the house in which they lived, and on the
ground floor of which he kept the saloon
which laid the foundations of his present
political influence. She spoke simply
and in good English, and one could
easily see how carefully she had been
shielded from all knowledge even of that
which went on around her.</p>

<p>An extraordinary company had assembled
to witness the ceremony and
take part in the festivities which followed,
and as I sat beside two brilliant,
shrewd, worldly-wise Hebrews of my acquaintance
we remarked that it would be
a long while before we could expect to
see another such gathering. The most
important of the guests were those high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in political authority or in the police department,
men whose election districts
are the modern prototype of the English
&#8220;pocket boroughs&#8221; of the last century;
while the humblest of them all, and the
merriest as well, was the deaf-and-dumb
boot-black of a down-town police court,
who appeared in the unwonted splendor
of a suit which he had hired especially
for the occasion, and to which was attached
a gorgeous plated watch-chain.
&#8220;Dummy&#8221; had never been to dancing-school,
but he was an adept in the art of
sliding across the floor, and he showed
his skill between the different sets, uttering
unintelligible cries of delight and
smiling blandly upon his acquaintances
as he glided swiftly by them.</p>

<p>Several of the gentlemen present had
&#8220;done time&#8221; in previous years, and
others&mdash;John Y. McKane for example&mdash;have
since then been &#8220;sent away.&#8221; I
saw one guest wink pleasantly at a police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
captain who was standing near him and
then slyly &#8220;lift&#8221; the watch from a
friend&#8217;s pocket, merely to show that he
had not lost his skill. A moment later
he awakened a little innocent mirth by
asking his unsuspecting friend what time
it was.</p>

<p>I dare say that a great many of my
readers imagine that at a festivity of this
description &#8220;down on the east side&#8221; the
men appear for the most part clad in the
red shirts which were in vogue at the
time of Thackeray&#8217;s visit to America, and
which now exist only in the minds of
those writers who are famous for the
accuracy of their local color. As for
the women, I have no doubt these same
readers picture them in garments similar
to those worn by the &#8220;tough girl&#8221; in
Mr. Harrigan&#8217;s drama, nor would they
be surprised to learn that there was a
fight every twenty minutes.</p>

<p>For their special benefit I will explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that nearly every one of the men wore
evening dress of the conventional pattern,
and that the display of diamonds
and costly gowns&mdash;many of which were
tasteful as well&mdash;was a noteworthy one.
There was an abundance of wine and
strong drink for everybody, and a very
thirsty company it was, too, but not a
sign of trouble did I see the whole evening
through. The truth of the matter is
that to the majority of the men and
women present a fight was a serious
affair, and one not to be entered into
lightly and unadvisedly.</p>

<p>For three hours I sat with my two
Israelitish friends&mdash;a pool-room keeper
and a dime-museum manager respectively&mdash;and
talked about the people who
passed and repassed before us, and I
am bound to say that the conversation
of a clever New York Jew of their type
is almost always edifying and amusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious thing,&#8221; said one of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
companions at last, &#8220;but I really believe
that we three men at this table are the
only ones in the whole room who have
any sort of sense of the picturesqueness
of this thing, or are onto the gang of
people gathered together here. There&#8217;s
probably not a soul in the room outside
of ourselves but what imagines that this
is just a plain, every-day sort of crowd
and not one of the most extraordinary
collections of human beings I&#8217;ve ever
seen in my life, and I&#8217;ve been knocking
round New York ever since I was knee-high.
There are thousands of people
giving up their good dust every week
to go in and look at the freaks in my
museum, and there&#8217;s not one of them
that&#8217;s as interesting as dozens that we
can see here to-night for nothing. Just
look at that woman over there that all
the politicians are bowing down to; and
they&#8217;ve got a right to, too, for she&#8217;s a
big power in the district and knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
more about politics than Barney Rourke.
They never dared pull <i>her</i> place when
the police were making all those raids
last month. Those diamonds she wears
are worth ten thousand if they&#8217;re worth
a cent. There&#8217;s a man who wouldn&#8217;t be
here to-night if it wasn&#8217;t for the time
they allow on a sentence for good behavior,
and that fellow next him keeps a
fence down in Elizabeth Street. There&#8217;s
pretty near every class of New Yorkers
represented here to-night except the
fellows that write the stories in the
magazines. Where&#8217;s Howells? I don&#8217;t
see him anywhere around,&#8221; he exclaimed,
ironically, rising from his chair
as he spoke and peering curiously about.
&#8220;Look under the table and see if he&#8217;s
there taking notes. Oh yes, I read the
magazines very often when I have time,
and some of the things I find in them
are mighty good; but when those literary
ducks start in to describe New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
or at least this part of it&mdash;well, excuse
<i>me</i>, I don&#8217;t want any of it. This would
be a great place, though, for a story-writer
to come to if he really wanted to
learn anything about the town.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am perfectly sure that if Mr. Gilder
had turned up at that wedding his
hands would not have been the only
ones &#8220;trun up&#8221; in honor of the visit.
And I firmly believe that the visit of the
<i>Century</i> editor to what is said to be the
most densely populated square mile in
the world will prove pregnant of great
results, and may perhaps mark a distinct
epoch in the history of letters.</p>

<p>On looking back over what I have
written, it seems to me that I have devoted
too much of my space to that
portion of the city which lies below the
barbed-wire fence; but I hope my transgression
will be pardoned in view of the
great significance of Mr. Gilder&#8217;s recent
explorations and also of the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
region itself is so rich in literary material
of the sort that a Victor Hugo or a
Dickens would have seized upon with
avidity. There are young men working
in newspaper offices now who will one of
these days draw true and vivid pictures
of modern New York as it appears in the
eyes and the brains of those who know it
thoroughly, and very interesting fiction
it will be, too. The late Mr. Mines (Felix
Oldboy) and Mr. Thomas A. Janvier have
written successfully and entertainingly of
the town that our fathers and grandparents
knew, but the book on New York of
to-day has yet to be written, and I know
of no one better qualified for the task
than my young friend the reporter,
whom I have personally addressed in
preceding chapters.</p>

<p>It seems to me something like high
treason to even hint of the possibility of
a break in the present literary dynasty&mdash;an
event which would be deplored by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
none more bitterly than by my loyal self.
Mr. Johnson&#8217;s powers are still unimpaired,
and his grasp on his pruning-hook is as
firm as it was on the day that he suggested
the reduction of the twelve flasks
to two or three. I desire nothing more
than that in history&#8217;s page my name shall
brightly glow beside his as his Boswell.
Mr. Bok has already shown such remarkable
capacity for benign and progressive
rule that we may look forward with a
reasonable degree of confidence to his
peaceful and undisputed accession to the
throne, and a new impetus to the sale of
his photographs, which are dirt-cheap at
a quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p>And yet let us not forget that France
was not always a republic nor Germany
a united empire; nor has there always
been a Guelph on the throne of Edward
the Confessor. During the past year a
new literary power has arisen among us
in the shape of the cheap magazines&mdash;<i>McClure&#8217;s</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and <i>Munsey&#8217;s</i>&mdash;a
power which is making itself felt
more strongly every day, and may in the
near future prove a serious menace to
the established order of things. The
rapidity with which these cheap monthlies
have established themselves in the
popular esteem is due primarily to the
low price at which they are offered, and
also, in a measure, to the fact that their
conductors have not grown up in the
<i>Ledger</i> or Johnson school, and therefore
are not accomplished in the sort of editing
which has reached its highest development
in the offices of the leading
monthlies. But it happens that each
one of these cheap periodicals is controlled
by a man of restless, energetic
temperament&mdash;what is known in common
parlance as a &#8220;hustler&#8221;&mdash;and if I
am not much mistaken each one of these
hustlers is firmly imbued with the American
fancy for exploring new and untried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
fields. Several of the stories published
in these cheap magazines are of a sort
forbidden in their more venerable contemporaries;
and while I am not prepared
to say that these stories are equal
in point of merit to the ones which have
been subjected to the Johnsonian process
of selection and elimination, they have
attracted attention because people found
them different from those to which they
had been accustomed.</p>

<p>Personally I have a profound faith in
American hustlers. To me the term hustling
is synonymous with those which describe
cable-laying, bridge-building, and
material progress of every kind, and
when hustlers go into the business of
publishing magazines it is time to be on
the lookout for change of some sort.
That the conductors of their older contemporaries
appreciate this fact and are
getting ready to trim sail if necessary is
made evident to me by the Harpers&#8217; publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of &#8220;Trilby,&#8221; and Mr. Gilder&#8217;s journey
to the populous kraals of the east
side.</p>

<p>I will say no more regarding the cheap
monthlies and their possible importance
in the near future, because I do not wish
to run the risk of being put on trial for
high treason; and so I will bring my
chapter to a close with a few words on a
subject which I am sure lies close to the
heart of every true woman in the land&mdash;the
unexampled philanthropy shown by
Mr. Bok in placing his photographs
within reach of the humblest and poorest
of his admirers. The editor&#8217;s philanthropy
is exceeded only by the diffidence
betrayed in his announcement of the address
of the photographer and the low
price charged for the portraits.</p>

<p>The code of etiquette which governs
the conduct of the dime-museum lecturer
ordains that no brutally frank or emphatic
allusions shall be made to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
pictures of the different human &#8220;freaks&#8221;
which are offered for sale. &#8220;I believe,&#8221;
says the lecturer, in a tone of complete
indifference, as he brings his glowing
eulogy of the &#8220;Tattooed Queen&#8221; to a fitting
close, &#8220;that the lady has a few of
her photographs which she wishes to dispose
of.&#8221; And as the lady has eight of
them in each hand, and twenty-two more
arranged along the edge of the platform
in front of her, even the most skeptical
audience is forced to admit that the professor&#8217;s
surmise is correct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; says the diffident Mr. Bok,
&#8220;that there are some fair likenesses of
myself for sale on Chestnut Street, and
I understand that they cost a quarter
apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>My readers can depend upon it that
what Mr. Bok has to say about those
photographs is absolutely true.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter. But first of all let us think of the
many mercies for which we have to be
thankful, and then let us be just as well
as generous; for certainly the magazines
have been of enormous benefit to the
reading public as well as to those whose
profession it is to entertain, amuse, or
instruct that public.</p>

<p>The magazines have not only raised the
rates of compensation for literary labor,
but they have spread the reading habit
to an enormous extent, and are still educating
vast numbers of people&mdash;of a class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
that do not read at all when they happen
to be born in other countries&mdash;to become
habitual buyers of books and periodicals.
Moreover it must be said of the editors of
these publications that they place their
time at the disposal of every aspiring
author who brings his manuscript to
them. In other words, they give careful
attention to whatever work is submitted
to them, and are glad to buy and pay
promptly for such stories and poems as
they may deem suitable to their needs. I
have never seen any disposition on the
part of any of them to crush budding
genius, but, on the contrary, I have frequently
met them on dark, rainy nights
hunting through the town with lanterns
in their hands for new writers. In fact,
I do not know of any place in this world
where a young man may look for fairer
attention and encouragement than he will
find in the office of a modern magazine.</p>

<p>I have heard these editors denounced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
one and all, by infuriated poets and romancers,
for the &#8220;favoritism&#8221; which had
been shown to certain contributors, but
I have generally found that when they
erred in this way it was on the side of
charity; and if certain writers whose contributions
we generally skip occupy more
room in the monthlies than we think they
ought to, it is not because they are editorial
pets, but because they have been
careful students of the great literary principles
described in these pages, and have
thereby acquired the art of writing exactly
what can be printed without injury
to the susceptibilities of a single advertiser
or subscriber.</p>

<p>But we have special cause for being
thankful to the magazines when we read
some of the hysterical, obstetrical, and
epigrammatic romances which have enjoyed
such an astonishing vogue in England
of late years. Thank Heaven! no
American magazine&mdash;so far as my knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
goes&mdash;has had the effrontery to offer
its readers any such noisome, diseased
literature as that with which the alleged
&#8220;clever&#8221; people of London have flooded
our market. To my way of thinking the
epigrammatic books are the most offensive
of the whole lot, and certainly there
is nothing better calculated to plunge one
into the depths of despair and shame than
the perusal of a modern British novel
whose characters are forever &#8220;showing
off,&#8221; as children say, and who seem to devote
their lives to uttering sixpenny cynicisms
and evolving, with infinite pains and
travail, the sort of remarks that pass current
in the &#8220;smart London set&#8221;&mdash;if these
chroniclers are to be believed&mdash;as wit.</p>

<p>Callow and ingenuous youth betrays
itself by two unmistakable earmarks.
One of these is in the form of a slight
down on the cheek, and the other is the
belief that Oscar Wilde writes brilliant
epigram.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>I attended the first American representation
of a play by that distinguished
author, and can well recall my feelings
when an able-bodied mummer took the
centre of the stage and said, with the air
of a man who has been rolling a good
thing under his tongue all the evening,
and at last has a chance to utter it:
&#8220;Time is the thief of procrastination.&#8221;
A murmur of admiration ran through
the house, but I&mdash;I sobbed like a heart-broken
child.</p>

<p>And yet Mr. Wilde is one of the cleverest
of the whole brood of fat-witted
chromo-cynics whose vulgar flippancies
have somehow come to be regarded as
witty and amusing, and that, too, by people
who ought to know better. It positively
makes me sick to see one of these
paper-covered chronicles of fashionable
imbecility lying on a parlor table, and to
hear it spoken of as &#8220;so delightfully
bright and clever, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>Heine was a genuine cynic and the
maker of epigrams which he wrote as
easily and naturally as Bobby Burns
wrote verses; and if there is anything in
the world which can be accomplished, if
at all, without manual labor and the accompanying
sweat of the brow, it is the
utterance of really witty or epigrammatic
remarks. But these leaden-footed English
wits somehow convey to me a vision
of a cynic in toil-stained overalls going
forth in the gray of the early morning,
dinner-pail in hand, for a hard day&#8217;s work
at being epigrammatic and funny.</p>

<p>And while I am on the subject of epigram
and cynicism, I cannot help wondering
what Heine would have done for
a living had his lot been cast in our own
age and country. Imagine him offering
manuscript to the <i>Ladies&#8217; Home Journal</i>!
(By the way, Bok ought not to let those
photographs go for twenty-five cents
apiece. They&#8217;re worth a dollar if they&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
worth a cent.) Think of the sensation
that the <i>Reisebilder</i> would create in the
<i>Century</i> office!</p>

<p>My own opinion is that Heine would,
were he living here to-day, find occupation
as a paragrapher on some Western paper,
acquire some nebulous renown as the
&#8220;<i>Ann Arbor Clarion</i> man&#8221; or the &#8220;<i>Omaha
Bumblebee</i> man,&#8221; and be consigned in his
old age to that Home for Literary Incurables
known as the McClure Syndicate.</p>

<p>There is a book of excerpts from the
writings of this gifted man, published
some years ago by Henry Holt &amp; Co.,
and now, unhappily enough, out of print.
These excerpts are so well selected and
convey to us so vividly the charm of this
matchless writer that I took the trouble
some time ago to inquire into the way in
which the work was done. I learned on
undisputed authority that Mr. Holt, who
has not spent his life in the literary business
for nothing, borrowed a pruning-hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
from the <i>Century</i> office, placed it,
together with Heine&#8217;s complete works, in
the hands of an experienced and skilled
magazine editor, and bade him &#8220;edit&#8221;
them as if they were intended for publication
in his own monthly. The skilled
and experienced editor opened the volumes,
and the pruning-hook&mdash;also a
skilled and experienced instrument of
mutilation&mdash;fairly leaped from its scabbard
in its eagerness to eliminate the
dangerous passages. When the editor
had completed his task Mr. Holt gathered
up the parings from the floor and published
them under the title of <i>Scintillations
from Heine</i>; and I sincerely hope
that a new edition of this book will be
brought out before long, if for no other
purpose than to show people what a real
epigram is and how sharp it can bite.</p>

<p>There is another variety of literature
which I dislike, and which seems to have
attained a ranker and more unwholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
growth in this country than elsewhere.
I refer to those articles and books whose
sole purpose seems to be the exploiting of
men and women who are really unworthy
of any serious consideration. The Johnsonian
period is rich in specimens of this
sort of work, and the future historian will
marvel at the absurd prominence given
in this enlightened age to people who
have never accomplished anything in
their lives, and who themselves evince
the greatest eagerness to transmit to posterity
authentic records of their failures.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I Lost the Battle,&#8221; by Captain
Runoff, of the Russian army; &#8220;Driven out
of Asia Minor,&#8221; by General Skates; and
&#8220;Ever so Many Miles from the North
Pole,&#8221; by Lieutenant Queary, are excellent
examples of this style of literature;
but a far lower depth was reached about
two years ago, when the Harpers burst
into enthusiastic praise of a young man
named Chanler, who had announced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
intention of discovering Africa, and proposed
to awe and conciliate the ferocious
native chiefs by performing in their presence
various difficult feats of legerdemain
which he had taken the pains to learn
from a professional master in London.</p>

<p>What has become of that gifted young
man for whom the Harpers predicted
such a rosy future? Perhaps at this very
moment he is seated in a deep, shady
African jungle making an omelet in
a high silk hat or converting a soiled
pocket-handkerchief into a glass globe
full of goldfish. I can picture him standing,
alone and unarmed, before thousands
of hostile spears. His eye is clear and
his cheek unblanched. In another moment
he will be taking rabbits out of the
chieftain&#8217;s ears, and the dusky warriors
will cower, in abject submission, at his
feet.</p>

<p>There is one thing that can be said in
favor of Mr. Chanler, and that is that up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
to the present moment he has not annoyed
his fellow-creatures with any lectures or
articles or stories descriptive of the wonders
that he did not discover during his
journeyings in the Dark Continent. His
reticence is commendable, and should
serve as an example to various windy
travelers who &#8220;explore&#8221; during a period
of eight weeks and then talk for the rest
of their lives.</p>

<p>Verily this is a golden age for &#8220;fakirs,&#8221;
quacks, and intellectual feather-weights,
and my friendly advice to all who may be
classified under any one of those three
heads is to make hay while the sun shines,
because, in my belief, the coming decade
will see them relegated to the obscurity
in which they naturally belong. But our
little tuppenny gods and celebrities have
kicked up so much dust of late years that
they have contrived to obscure the fame
of men who are infinitely better worth
talking about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>Singularly enough, the American who
achieved more with his pen than any one
else in his generation is almost unknown
to the majority of his countrymen and
countrywomen, although our government
paid an unusual tribute to his memory by
bringing his remains back to his native
land in a man-of-war. The man of whom
I write was simply a reporter employed
by the <i>New York Herald</i> to chronicle contemporaneous
European history. It was
he who told the civilized world the truth
about the atrocities committed by the
Turkish invaders of Bulgaria in a series
of letters to the <i>London Daily News</i>&mdash;letters
which became, in the hands of
Mr. Gladstone, a weapon with which he
aroused the popular feeling until the Beaconsfield
ministry was swept from power
and the Jingo spirit held in check while
Russia carried on her &#8220;holy war&#8221; against
the Porte. There is not a statesman or
sovereign in Europe who does not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of the important rôle which this American
reporter played in continental affairs
at the time of the Russo-Turkish war. If
you ask a Bulgarian or Montenegrin if
he ever heard of J. A. MacGahan he will
very likely say to you what one of them
said to me: &#8220;Did you, an American, ever
hear of George Washington? Well, MacGahan
was our Washington, and there is
not a peasant in all my country who is
not familiar with his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>This countryman of ours, in whose
achievements I have such a sturdy pride,
died literally in the harness in 1879, and
every year on the 9th of June, throughout
all the land of which he was the acknowledged
savior, the solemn prayers of the
church are offered for the repose of his
soul. It may be that he has won a higher
fame than he would if he had lived to
make himself known to the American
public through the medium of the lecture
platform, but nevertheless I often wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
that his renown in the land of his birth
were nearer in accord with his deserts
than it is.</p>

<p>I doubt if any system, either literary,
political, or social&mdash;unless it be negro
slavery&mdash;has ever had a fairer trial in
this country than has that of pruning-hook
editing, of which I have treated in
these pages; and that system may be responsible,
in part, for the fact that three
quarters of the fiction offered in bookstores
to-day is the work of foreign writers,
most of whom have been reared in
the comparatively free and independent
literary atmosphere of Great Britain, and
have always addressed their books directly
to the public instead of the editors of magazines.
It is true that Smith or Mudie,
whose influence in the book-trade is almost
incalculable, occasionally refuse to
circulate a novel out of consideration for
the feelings of the &#8220;young person,&#8221; but
such a proceeding is not nearly as disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to a writer as the refusal of his manuscript
by all the magazines would be to
an American. A ton of manuscript makes
no more commotion when returned to its
authors than the touch of a humming-bird
on a lily-petal; but when a book like
<i>Esther Waters</i> is cast out of an English
circulating library it falls with a crash
that is heard throughout the length and
breadth of the three kingdoms, while the
author and his friends, with a little assistance
from the author&#8217;s enemies, make
the welkin ring with their cries.</p>

<p>The recent discussion over &#8220;Trilby&#8221;
and the action of its publishers in cutting
out this passage and pruning that have
given the public a little insight into the
methods in vogue in our large literary
establishments&mdash;methods which I have
tried to explain in this book. The very
fact that Mr. Du Maurier&#8217;s manuscript
stood in need of the pruning-hook is, to
me, proof positive that he never sat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the poets&#8217; bench in the <i>Ledger</i> office or
practised his profession under the rule of
Dr. Holland.</p>

<p>It may be that at this very moment a
great many American story-readers are
asking themselves why it is that native
authors who know their trade so well
that the magazines will publish anything
that they offer should be unable to write
a serial equal to that of a gray-haired
novice like Mr. Du Maurier, who, I will
wager, knows absolutely nothing about
the immortal principles which are the
very lamps unto the feet of his American
contemporaries. I shudder to think of
what the world would have lost had the
author of &#8220;Trilby&#8221; gone about his work
with the Holland fetters on his wrists,
the fear of the gas-fitter in his heart, the
awful pruning-hook hanging by a single
hair over his head, and the ominous
shadow of Robert Bonner falling across
the pages of his story.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>There are other English writers who
have &#8220;arrived&#8221; during the past half-dozen
years&mdash;a sufficient number, indeed, to
make us feel that there must be some
deep-seated cause for the comparatively
slow progress which our own literature
has made in the same time.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to fairly estimate
the literary worth of writers who have
been before the public such a short time,
especially when we take into consideration
the wide difference in personal tastes, and
therefore I have sought the aid of a number
of critical and learned friends in the
preparation of a list of writers which I
confess is not exactly the one that I would
print had I consulted only my own personal
tastes.</p>

<p>This is the list which I offer as a result
of many consultations with people who
are supposed to understand the subject:
J. M. Barrie, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Hall
Caine, Rudyard Kipling, Conan Doyle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Barry Paine, J. K. Jerome, I. Zangwill,
Marie Corelli, Quiller Couch, S. R. Crockett,
Sarah Grand, Beatrice Harraden, Anthony
Hope, and Stanley J. Weyman&mdash;fifteen
in all besides Mr. Du Maurier.</p>

<p>From this catalogue of talent and genius
it is possible to select ten whose position
in letters is assured, although tastes
will differ as to the names on the last end
of the list.</p>

<p>Now let us see how many writers have
been raised to maturity in the carefully
watched and over-cultivated magazine
soil during the same period of time&mdash;say
half a dozen years. Can we point to sixteen,
or ten, or even five who have made
their way into the great white light within
that time?</p>

<p>No; we have precisely one writer to
show as the fruit of American literary endeavor
during six years, and that writer
is a woman who has confined herself&mdash;and
wisely, too, I suspect&mdash;to the portrayal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
of life and character among the
New England hills and villages. A narrow
field, it may be said, but she has surveyed
it with the true artistic eye, and at
her touch it has yielded truthful, appreciative,
honest literature&mdash;stories with an
underlying note of sadness that rings true
as steel and is a bit of the very essence of
rural New England life. Of course this
writer is in an enviable position because
she enjoys all the advantages of magazine
authorship and the prestige which
accompanies it, and is, to all practical
purposes, exempt from the ordeal of the
pruning-hook to which other authors are
obliged to submit. I do not say this in
disparagement of her great talents; I only
mean to say that her stories all lie within
the necessary magazine limitations, and
she can write to the very top of her bent
without getting within gunshot of the
barbed-wire fences which restrict the endeavors
of authors whose natural impulse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
it is to work in the deeper and broader
strata of humanity.</p>

<p>I do not deny that there are several
bright and clever young men and women
who have done excellent literary work in
the magazines and will undoubtedly live
to do even better in the future. I know
of two or three who are, according to my
way of thinking, better entitled to mention
than some of the English authors
whom I have named; but the woman
whom I have in mind is the one recent
acquisition to American letters, who draws
truthful pictures from a proper point of
view, writes fully as well to-day as she did
six years ago, and has, moreover, given us
one good novel. I do not know of a single
other bright young American writer&mdash;and
very clever some of them are, too&mdash;of
whom nearly as much as this can be
fairly said.</p>

<p>If the names of Hamlin Garland or
Edward Bellamy occur to any of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
readers it should be remembered that
they sprang up by the wayside and are
not the product of the rich magazine soil.</p>

<p>In bringing my modest preachment to
a close, it is with a hope that my readers
will pardon any errors of humor into
which I may have fallen, or at least find
in them a reasonable excuse for my effrontery
in offering advice while I am
still under ninety-seven years of age. I
hope that I have done full justice to the
established literary dynasty which began
with Robert Bonner and of which Mr.
Johnson is now the acknowledged head.</p>

<p>And let my last word be one of thankfulness
because that dynasty has at least
kept our national literature clean&mdash;as
clean as a whistle or a pipe-stem.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE POETS&#8217; STRIKE.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was just three o&#8217;clock on a warm
day in August, and the deep silence that
prevailed in the Franklin Square Prose
and Verse Foundry indicated plainly that
something unusual had happened. The
great trip-hammer in the basement was
silent; there was no whir of machinery
on the upper floors; and in the vast, deserted
dialect department the busy file
was still. It was only in the business
office that any signs of life were visible,
and there the chiefs of the great establishment
were gathered in anxious consultation.
Their stern, determined faces
indicated that they had taken a stand and
had resolved to maintain it, no matter
what might happen. From the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
came the faint sound of newsboys crying
extras. By nightfall the tidings would
be carried to the remotest corners of the
town.</p>

<p>The poets of the Franklin Square Foundry
had been ordered out on strike!</p>

<p>Well might the heads of the various
departments look grave, for never before
in the history of the factory had there
been a strike in its literary department.
Down in Pearl Street the poets were congregated
in groups, talking over the situation
and casting ominous glances at
the great window, through which they
could faintly distinguish the forms of
the men against whose tyranny they had
rebelled.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tall form loomed up in the
centre of a large group of excited men.
It was a master poet who had climbed
up on some boxes to address his comrades;
and they grew quiet and closed in
about him to hear his words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>&#8220;Prosers, rhymesters, and dialectists,&#8221;
exclaimed the master poet, &#8220;the time has
come for us to make a stand against the
oppression of those who call themselves
our masters. The time has come for the
men who toil day after day in yonder
tall factory to denounce the infamous
system by which they are defrauded of
the greater part of their wretched pittance.
You know, of course, that I am
speaking of the ruinous competition of
scab or non-union labor. See that cart!&#8221;
he cried, pointing to a square, one-horse
vehicle, similar to those employed in the
delivery of coal, which had been backed
up against the curb in front of the factory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what that cart contains?
See those men remove the iron
scuttle on the sidewalk, and listen to the
roar and rumble as the cart discharges
its contents into the cellar beneath the
pavement! Is that coal they are putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
in with which to feed the tireless engine
that furnishes motive power to the factory?
No, my friends; that is a load of
jokes for the back page of <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>,
collected from the sweating-shops about
Washington Square and Ninth Street.
Do those jokes bear the union label?
They do not. Many of them, no doubt,
are made by Italians and Chinese, to
the shame and degradation of our calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master poet&#8217;s words were received
with a howl of rage that reached the ears
of the men who were closeted in the business
office, and brought a pallor to their
stern, set faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no time to be lost!&#8221; exclaimed
one of the firm; &#8220;that yell of
defiance convinces me that any attempt
to introduce non-union poets would precipitate
a riot. It will not be safe to
do it unless we are prepared for the
worst.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>&#8220;For my part,&#8221; said Mr. Harry Harper,
&#8220;I believe that it would be a good
policy for us to introduce machinery at
once, and get rid of those poets, who are
forever making new demands on us. The
<i>Century</i> people have had machines in
operation for some time past, and have
found them very satisfactory. We must
admit that a great deal of their poetry is
as good as our hand-made verses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; cried Mr. Alden, &#8220;that
that Chicago machine they put in some
time ago is simply one of Armour&#8217;s old
sausage-mills remodeled? It is the invention
of a man named Fuller, who two
years ago was merely an able-bodied
workman in the serial shops. It is really
a very ingenious piece of mechanism,
and when you think that they throw a
quantity of hoofs, hair, and other waste
particles from the Chicago stock-yards
into a hopper, and convert them into a
French or Italian serial story of firm, fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
texture&mdash;well, making a silk purse out of
a sow&#8217;s ear is nothing to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the head of the firm,
rising as he spoke, and taking from the
desk beside him some large cardboard
signs, &#8220;I do not propose to have my own
workmen dictate to <i>me</i>. I am going to
hang these signs on our front door and
give employment to whomever may apply
for it.&#8221; The signs were thus inscribed:</p>

<p class="caption">STEADY EMPLOYMENT<br />

<small>TWO RHYMES TO THE QUATRAIN.</small></p>

<p>But before Mr. Harper could carry out
his resolution, a young man, clad in the
ordinary working-garb of a poet, hurriedly
entered the office, and, placing himself
before the chief, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, sir, before it is too late!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are you, sir?&#8221; demanded the
amazed publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Henry Rondeau,&#8221; replied the
young man, &#8220;and although I am only a
humble, laboring poet, I feel that I can
be of assistance to you to-day. I have a
grateful heart, and cannot forget your
kindness to me when I was unfortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindness? I confess that I do not
remember any&mdash;&#8221; began Mr. Harper; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the poet interrupted him with: &#8220;Last
summer, sir, when I got my fingers frost-bitten
by being permitted to shake hands
with Mr. Harry Harper, you not only
allowed me half-pay, but gave my poor
idiot sister a job in the factory as a reader
of manuscript, thus enabling us to keep
the wolf from the door until I was able
to use a scanning-rule again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a most invaluable assistant she
is, too,&#8221; cried Mr. Alden, warmly; &#8220;she
selects all the short stories for the magazine,
and I doubt if you could find, even
in the office of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, any
one with such keen perceptions of what
the public do not want as Susan Rondeau,
the idiot reader of Franklin Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment a hoarse yell arose from
the crowd of strikers beneath the window,
and was borne to the ears of those who
were gathered in the business office.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that noise mean?&#8221; demanded
the senior partner, an angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
flush suffusing his cheek. &#8220;Do they
think they can frighten me with yells
and threats of violence? I will hang out
these signs, and bid them do their worst!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! I implore you, stop!&#8221; cried
Henry Rondeau, as he threw himself before
his chief. &#8220;The sight of those signs
would madden them, and the counsel of
the cooler heads, which has thus far controlled
them, would be swept away in a
moment. And then&mdash;the deluge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do not fear even death,&#8221; cried
the courageous publisher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harper,&#8221; continued the young
workman, earnestly, &#8220;at this very moment
the master poet is urging them to
desperate measures. He has already in his
possession the address and dinner-hour of
every gentleman in this room, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, even if dynamite is to be used&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; pursued Henry Rondeau, &#8220;he
has threatened to place the list in the
hands of Stephen Masset!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&#8220;Merciful heavens!&#8221; exclaimed the veteran
publisher, as he sank, pale and trembling,
in his easy-chair, while his associates
wrung their hands in bitter despair; &#8220;can
nothing be done to prevent it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried the young working-man.
&#8220;Accept the offer of the Poets&#8217; Union to
make a new sliding-scale. Make a few
slight concessions to the men, and they
will meet you half-way. Put emery wheels
in the dialect shop instead of the old-fashioned
cross-cut files and sandpaper
that now take up so much of the men&#8217;s
time. Let one rhyme to the quatrain be
sufficient at the metrical benches, and&mdash;it
is a little thing, but it counts&mdash;buy some
tickets for the poets&#8217; picnic and summer-night&#8217;s
festival at Snoozer&#8217;s Grove,
which takes place next Monday afternoon
and evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Rondeau&#8217;s advice was taken, and
to-day the great trip-hammer is at work
in the basement of the foundry, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
poets and prose-writers are busy at their
benches on the upper floors. The master
poet is at work among the rest, and sometimes
he chuckles as he thinks of the
concessions that were wrung from the
foundry-owners by the great August
strike. But little does the master poet
dream of the vengeance that awaits him&mdash;of
the awful midnight oath taken by
Joseph Harper after he had signed the
treaty with his employees.</p>

<p>Not until after death will that oath be
fulfilled. Not until the members of the
Poets&#8217; Union have borne the remains of
their chief to Calvary with a following as
numerous as that which accompanies the
deceased aunt of a Broadway janitor to
her last resting-place&mdash;not until then will
the surviving members of the firm carry
out the sacred trust imposed upon them.</p>

<p>They will collect the poems of the master
poet and publish them in a mouse-colored
volume&mdash;<i>edited by Arthur Stedman</i>.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE SOBER, INDUSTRIOUS POET,<br />

<small>AND HOW HE FARED AT EASTER-TIME.</small></h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Alas</span>, Mary!&#8221; exclaimed William
Sonnet, as he entered his neat but humble
tenement apartment a few days before
the close of Lent, &#8220;I fear that our Pfingst
holiday this year will be anything but a
merry one. My employers have notified
me that if they receive any more complaints
of the goods from my department
they will give me the sack.&#8221;</p>

<p>William Sonnet was certainly playing
in hard luck, although it would be difficult
to find in the whole of Jersey City a
more industrious, sober young poet, or a
more devoted husband and father. For
nine years he had been employed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Empire Prose and Verse Foundry, the
largest literary establishment on the banks
of the Hackensack, where by sheer force
of sobriety and industry he had risen from
the humble position of cash-boy at the
hexameter counter to that of foreman of
the dialect floor, where forty-five hands
were kept constantly employed on prose
and verse. During these years his relations
with his employers, Messrs. Rime
&amp; Reeson, had been of the pleasantest
nature until about six months previous
to the opening of this story, when they
began&mdash;unjustly, as it seemed to him&mdash;to
find fault with the goods turned out by
his department. There were complaints
received at the office every day, they said,
of both the dialect stories and verses that
bore the Empire brand.</p>

<p>The <i>Century Magazine</i> had returned a
large invoice of hand-sewed negro dialect
verses of the &#8220;Befoh de Wah&#8221; variety,
and a syndicate which supplied the Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
market had canceled all its spring
orders on the ground that the dialect
goods had for some reason or other fallen
far below the standard maintained in the
other departments of the Empire Foundry.
William was utterly unable to account
for this change in the quality of
the manuscript prepared on his floor, and
as he sat with his bowed head resting on
his toil-hardened hand, and the sweat and
grime of honest labor on his brow, he
looked, indeed, the very picture of dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;William,&#8221; said his wife, as she placed
a caressing hand on his forehead, &#8220;you
have enemies in the foundry whom you
do not suspect. You must know that
when you wooed and won me a year ago
I had been courted by no less than four
different poets who at that time were
employed at the Eagle Verse Works in
Newark, but have since found positions
with Messrs. Rime &amp; Reeson. I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
deny, William, that I toyed with the affections
of those poets, but it was because I
deemed them as frivolous as myself, and
when they went from my presence with
angry threats on their lips I laughed in
merry glee. But when I saw them standing
together on street corners, with their
heads together in earnest conversation, I
grew sick at heart, for I knew it boded
us no good. Be warned, William, by my
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day, when the whistle blew at
noon, William Sonnet ate his dinner from
his tin pail as usual; but then, instead of
going out into the street to play baseball
with the poets from the adjacent factories,
as the Empire Foundry employees
generally did, he took a quiet stroll
through the whole establishment, under
the pretense of looking for an envoy
that had been knocked off the end of a
ballade.</p>

<p>In the packing-department was a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
consignment of goods from his floor ready
for shipment, and he stopped to examine
the burr of a Scotch magazine story to
make sure that it had not been rubbed off
by carelessness. What was his surprise
to find that the dialect, which he himself
had gone over with a cross-cut file that
very morning, was now worn completely
smooth by contact with an emery-wheel!
He replaced the story carefully in the
fine sawdust in which it was packed, and
then examined the other goods. They
had not yet been touched, but it was
evident to him that the miscreants fully
intended to finish the destructive work
which they had only had time to begin.
Returning to his own bench, he passed
two or three poets who were talking
earnestly together, and by straining his
ears he heard one of them whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll finish the job to-night. Meet
me at ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was enough for William Sonnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
He determined, without delay, what course
to pursue.</p>

<p>At half-past nine that evening, three
mysterious figures draped in black cloaks
entered the Empire Prose and Verse
Foundry by a side door. William Sonnet
was one of the three, and the others
were his employers, Messrs. Rime &amp; Reeson.
He led them to a place of concealment
which commanded a full view of
the packing-room. Before long stealthy
footsteps were heard, and the four conspirators
entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said the eldest of the quartet,
as he threw the light from his dark lantern
on the sullen faces of his companions;
&#8220;you all know why we are here.
This night we will complete William Sonnet&#8217;s
ruin, and Easter Monday will find
him hunting for work in Paterson and
Newark, and hunting in vain. Why is he
foreman of the dialect department, while
we toil at the bench for a mere crust?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Mary Birdseye is now his bride; but
when we wooed her we were rejected like
our own poems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that, too, although we inclosed
no postage,&#8221; retorted the second poet, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now to work,&#8221; continued the first
speaker, as he stooped to examine some
goods on the floor. &#8220;What have we here?
A serial for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>? Well,
we&#8217;ll soon fix that,&#8221; and in another moment
he had injected a quantity of ginger
into the story, ruining it completely.
Then the work of destruction went on,
while Messrs. Rime &amp; Reeson watched
the vandals with horror depicted on their
faces. A pan of sweepings from the
humorous department, designed for Harper&#8217;s
&#8220;Editor&#8217;s Drawer&#8221; and the <i>Bazar</i>,
was thrown away, and real funny jokes
substituted for them. A page article for
the Sunday supplement of a New York
daily, entitled &#8220;Millionaires who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Gold Filling in their Teeth,&#8221; embellished
with cuts of twenty different jaws, was
thrown out, and an article on &#8220;Jerusalem
the Golden,&#8221; ordered by the <i>Whited Sepulchre</i>,
substituted.</p>

<p>Messrs. Rime &amp; Reeson could control
themselves no longer. Stacked against
the wall like a woodpile were the twelve
instalments of a <i>Century</i> serial by Amelia
E. Barr, which had been sawed into the
proper lengths that afternoon. Seizing
one of these apiece, the three men made
a sudden onslaught on the miscreants and
beat them into insensibility. Then they
bound them securely and delivered them
over to the tormentors.</p>

<p>As for honest William Sonnet, he was
made foreman of the whole foundry; and
his wife, who was a fashion-writer, and
therefore never fit to be seen, received a
present of two beautiful new tailor-made
dresses, which fitted her so well that no
one recognized her, and she opened a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
line of credit at all the stores in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>It was a happy family that sat down to
the Easter dinner in William Sonnet&#8217;s
modest home; and to make their joy
complete, before the repast was ended an
envelope arrived from William&#8217;s grateful
employers containing an appointment for
his bedridden mother-in-law as reader
for a large publishing house.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE TWO BROTHERS;<br />

<small>OR, PLUCKED FROM THE BURNING.</small></h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;No</span>, Herbert, I would advise you to
tear up that card and put temptation away
from you. If you yield now you will
weaken your moral character, and you will
have less strength to resist another time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker, a young man of grave,
honest aspect, was standing with his hand
laid in a kindly way on his younger brother&#8217;s
shoulder. The latter, whose face
was cast in a more delicate and a weaker
mould, stood irresolutely twirling in his
hand a card of invitation to an afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what harm it will do just
for this one time,&#8221; he said, pettishly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
&#8220;You&#8217;re always preaching about temptation,
John; but, for my part, I think it&#8217;s
my duty as a writer to see a little of every
side of life. I want to write a novel some
day and to have one of the scenes laid at
a kettledrum. How can I describe one
unless I see it myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, Herbert,&#8221; said the elder brother,
mildly, &#8220;that you will never sink so
low as to write a New York Society novel;
but that is surely what you will come to
if you abandon yourself to the pernicious
habit of attending afternoon teas. Do
you remember your old playfellow, Walter
Weakfish? It is only three years since
he began to sip tea at kettledrums. At
that time he was considered one of the
very best reporters in the city, while at
the poker table he commanded universal
respect. You know, of course, that his
downward career has been very rapid
since his first fall, and that he has
sounded every depth of ignominy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
shame; but do you know where he is
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard some time ago,&#8221; replied Herbert,
&#8220;that he had become an habitual
frequenter of the most exclusive musical
circles in Boston, and that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; interrupted the elder; &#8220;that was
a malicious report. It is true that he
once attended an organ recital, but that
was all. At present he is conducting,
over his own signature, a department entitled
&#8216;Old Uncle Squaretoes&#8217;s Half-hour
Chats with the Little Folks,&#8217; in a Philadelphia
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merciful heavens!&#8221; cried Herbert; &#8220;I
had no idea it was as bad as that; but can
nothing be done to save him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not,&#8221; replied the elder brother,
sadly; &#8220;and now, Herbert, I shall say no
more. You must choose your own course;
but remember that our poker club meets
to-night in the room over Cassidy&#8217;s Exchange,
and you must&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, and drop another double X,&#8221; exclaimed
Herbert, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And learn the great lesson of life,&#8221;
said John, &#8220;that in this vale of tears the
hand that shapes our destiny will ofttimes
beat three of a kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with these impressive words John
Dovetail departed, leaving his brother
still twirling the engraved card between
his fingers and hesitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; he exclaimed at last, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care what John says. I&#8217;m sick of
his preaching, anyhow; and besides I&#8217;m
not going to get the Society habit fastened
on me through just one kettledrum! I&#8217;ll
go there just to see what it&#8217;s like.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon Herbert tasted of the
forbidden intoxicant of feminine flattery,
drank five cups of tea, and ate four pieces
of sticky cake. He was introduced to a
leader of the Chromo Literary Set, who
told him that she &#8220;adored clever men,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and begged him to come to her next Sunday
evening reception. Then he allowed
himself to be patronized by a dude who
copied letters in a broker&#8217;s office by day
and led the cotillion by night; and he
had not been in the drawing-room half an
hour before his mind became affected by
the &#8220;Society talk&#8221; going on about him
to such a degree that he found himself
chuckling in a knowing manner at an
idiotic story about Ollie Winkletree, of
the Simian Club.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the warning
words of his brother John suddenly came
back to him, and he realized that it was
time to go.</p>

<p>He had no appetite for dinner that
night&mdash;the tea and the sticky cake had
done their work; and instead of joining
the poker class over Cassidy&#8217;s Exchange,
he sat down by the fire to brood over the
new life that was opening before him.
The Society bee&mdash;the most malevolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
insect in the world&#8217;s hive&mdash;had stung
him under his bonnet, the poison was
already in his veins, and when John
returned at midnight from the poker
meeting his brother addressed him as
&#8220;deah boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now John Dovetail had always looked
after his younger brother with the same
solicitude that he would have bestowed
upon a helpless child, and to-night there
was an anxious look in his face as he
seated himself by the open fire and drew
from his vest-pocket the cigar which he
had won by throwing dice with Cassidy
at the Exchange. He was prepared to
enjoy himself for a half-hour in that
peace of mind which an easy conscience
alone can give. His evening had been
well spent&mdash;thanks to that merciful dispensation
which has ordained that even
the vilest sinner shall fill a bobtail flush
once in a while&mdash;and yet, as he sat there
before the glowing embers, dark misgivings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
filled his mind. Older than his
brother by fully four years, and of infinitely
wider experience and knowledge
of the world, he knew only too well the
danger that lurked in the leaves of the
five-o&#8217;clock tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I hear
that the Swelled Head is very prevalent
this winter. It is contagious, and there
is no place&mdash;not even an amateur theatrical
company&mdash;where one is so sure to
be exposed to it as at a kettledrum.
Suppose, after my years of watchful care,
my poor brother were to be taken down
with it!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The weeks rolled on, and Herbert,
having once yielded to temptation, soon
found it almost impossible to control his
appetite for Society functions. Not only
had he formed as undesirable a list of
acquaintances as he could have made by
heading the cotillion for three seasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
but he even had the temerity to tell his
brother John&mdash;whose life was still one
of noble purpose and lofty endeavor&mdash;that
he wondered how he could spend
all his evenings playing poker in the
room over Cassidy&#8217;s Exchange, instead
of&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of what, Herbert?&#8221; demanded
John, in clear, ringing accents. &#8220;Instead
of doing as you have been doing ever
since you took your first plunge into the
maelstrom of tea and cake and lemonade
that is fast whirling you to destruction?
No, Herbert, I have watched you day by
day, and I have noted the change that
has gradually come over you. For weeks
past you have been gradually growing
apart from me and from your old-time
associates, and have affiliated yourself
with a class of people who are far beneath
you. Where were you last night at the
hour when you should have been opening
jack-pots in the room over Cassidy&#8217;s Exchange?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
You were up-town skipping the
tralaloo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herbert started and grew pale. &#8220;How
did you find that out?&#8221; he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And whose tralaloo were you skipping?&#8221;
continued John, sternly, without
heeding the interruption. &#8220;You were
tralalooing with the De Sneides of Steenth
Street, and you dare not deny it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; exclaimed the younger brother,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any harm in that. Isn&#8217;t
the De Sneide family all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>John Dovetail&#8217;s clear, honest eyes blazed
with anger. Then with a great effort
he controlled himself, and went on in a
voice which trembled a little in spite of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right? Herbert Dovetail, do you
dare to stand before me and to talk about
the De Sneides being all right, when you
yourself told me that they concocted from
a half-pint of Santa Cruz rum&mdash;a half-pint,
mind you&mdash;a beverage which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
served to over one hundred human souls?
And did they not add to this crime that
of blasphemy, by calling it punch? O
Herbert! Do you know what will happen
if you keep on in the path which you
have chosen? You will become the victim
of that awful form of paresis known as
the Swelled Head. Already I have noticed
symptoms of it in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; cried Herbert, impatiently;
&#8220;just as soon as a man begins
to go into Society a little you say he&#8217;s got
the Swelled Head. It&#8217;s simply because
you&#8217;re jealous of my success&mdash;but what&#8217;s
the matter, John? Are you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>For his brother was leaning against
the table, his hand pressed to his heart
and his face white with an awful fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merciful heavens!&#8221; John exclaimed;
&#8220;a sure and unfailing sign; the poor boy
is stricken already and does not know it.
But he shall be saved!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>One night John persuaded his brother
to attend a meeting of the poker class, by
telling him that two German gentlemen
who had played the game just enough to
think they knew it all were going to be
present.</p>

<p>Herbert accepted the invitation chiefly
because he knew he would not meet any
one he had borrowed money from, and
was given a kindly welcome by his old
associates, although, owing to the peculiar
nature of his disease, he had failed to
recognize several of them when he met
them in the street the week before.</p>

<p>To be sure, he cast a slight gloom over
the company by calling for sherry when
the rest of the company were drinking
the old stuff; but that was pardoned
because of his unfortunate tea-drinking
propensities, and the game went on merrily.</p>

<p>Something of the old light came back
into the boy&#8217;s eye as the pile of chips in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
front of him began to grow apace; and
the old glad smile lit up his face once
more as Baron Snoozer laid down two big
pair only to be confronted by Herbert&#8217;s
three little fellows.</p>

<p>And yet still he called for sherry.</p>

<p>But it is always the unexpected that
happens. Just as the game broke up the
waiter informed John Dovetail that there
was a gentleman down-stairs who wished
to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him up!&#8221; cried John, pleasantly,
as he cashed in his chips.</p>

<p>The stranger appeared and John arose
to greet him. He wore a large chrysanthemum
in his buttonhole and held a
macaroon in his hand, which he nibbled
from time to time. His make-up was
that of a dude.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know me, I fear,&#8221; he said
to John. &#8220;I am sadly changed, I know;
but the time was, gentlemen, when I sat
at this very table; and, oh, how I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
have enjoyed a night like this!&#8221; he added,
glancing significantly at the rueful faces
of the two German gentlemen, who were
turning their pockets inside out.</p>

<p>All the members of the club were now
listening with intense interest; and John
began with, &#8220;Your face, sir, seems
strangely familiar&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said the visitor, with a sad
smile, &#8220;until you hear my story. Once,
as I said before, I sat in this very game
nearly every night; but now what am I?
One day&mdash;it was five years ago&mdash;some
fiend incarnate led me all unknowing to a
reception in an artist&#8217;s studio. Tea was
ordered&mdash;I partook of it and was lost.
Since then I have gone down, down,
down; and to-morrow I leave this city
forever. There is but one thing left for
me to do. You will see me no more after
to-night. Do none of you remember
Walter Weakfish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walter Weakfish!&#8221; gasped John.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
&#8220;Why, I thought you were in Philadelphia,
doing the &#8216;Old Uncle&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the unhappy young man,
&#8220;I have been worse than that. I have
been a Society reporter. Yes, it is I who
have written about the lovely &#8216;Spriggie&#8217;
Stone and the queenly Mrs. &#8216;Jack&#8217; Astorbilt,
who wore a passementerie of real
lace down the front breadth of her moire
antique gown. I wrote about those people
so much that finally I imagined that
I knew them; and then I borrowed
money from people who did know them,
and ordered clothes from their tailors,
until now Avenue A is my favorite thoroughfare.
And now I must leave the city
forever; but, Herbert, do you take warning
from the wreck you see before you
now. Good-by, my old friends!&#8221; And
Walter Weakfish started for the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay!&#8221; cried John. &#8220;Can we do
nothing for you? Shall we never see
you again?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Walter, pausing for a
moment on the threshold, &#8220;never again:
for I am going to Washington to patrol
the great national free-lunch route which
they call Official Society, and to write
correspondence for the Western papers.
After that, the morgue.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed, and he was gone.
Then a moment&#8217;s silence was broken by
a wail of anguish from Herbert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven!&#8221; cried John, &#8220;his
heart is touched, and he is saved. Everybody
in the room have something with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And before morning the swelling in
Herbert&#8217;s head was reduced so rapidly
that he had to drink thirteen hot Scotches
to counteract it. And from that day to
this he has never been to another kettledrum,
nor taken anything stronger than
rye whisky.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN OF TALENT.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a Young
Man of Talent, whose stories were so
good that the editor of the paper on
which he was employed heard the Professional
Humorist, who had been attached
to the paper for twenty-eight
years, ask the city editor, &#8220;what the
deuce the old man meant by loading up
the Sunday supplement with all that
stuff;&#8221; and the very next night the
Young Man asked if he might sign his
name to his special articles in the Sunday
paper. Now this was a privilege which
had never been accorded to anybody who
knew how to write, and the editor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
afraid to make an exception in favor of
the Young Man for fear of bringing down
upon his own head the wrath of the prize-fighters,
skirt-dancers, prominent citizens,
and other windbags who had always regarded
signed articles as their special
prerogative.</p>

<p>So he made answer that the signature
was usually considered a badge of shame.
But the Young Man persisted in his demand
until the editor was forced to give
way, and the following Sunday the eyes
of the Professional Humorist fell upon an
article which bore the signature of the
Young Man of Talent, and which was
sandwiched in between a graphic description
of &#8220;How I Slugged McGonegal&#8217;s
Unknown,&#8221; by Rocksey McIntyre, and
&#8220;The Spontaneity of Mediæval Art,&#8221; by
Professor Stuffe.</p>

<p>A jealous, angry light gleamed in the
eyes of the Professional Humorist, and
he swore an awful oath to be revenged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
on the rival who had come into the field
with a variety of humor that would inevitably
put an end to his own calling&mdash;that
of manufacturing &#8220;crisp paragraphs&#8221;&mdash;which
he had pursued without
interruption for more than a quarter of a
century.</p>

<p>Now the Professional Humorist belonged
to the &#8220;Association of Old-time
Funny Men,&#8221; to which nobody could gain
admittance who was under fifty-five years
of age or who had ever been guilty of an
original piece of humor.</p>

<p>When one of the order wrote a crisp
paragraph about a door being not a door
when it happened to be ajar, it would become
the duty of some fellow-member to
quote it with the prefix: &#8220;Billy Jaggs of
the <i>Blankburgh Banner</i> says&mdash;&#8221; and add
some refined pleasantry of this sort:
&#8220;Billy&#8217;s mouth is usually ajar when the
whisky-jug goes round. How is that
for high, Jaggsey, old boy?&#8221; and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
crisp paragraph would be &#8220;passed along&#8221;
after the fashion prevalent in the old
days when American humor was struggling
for popular recognition.</p>

<p>So the Professional Humorist communicated
with his fellow funny men,
and told them that unless concerted
measures were taken the old-fashioned
crisp paragraphs would be relegated to
the obscurity shared by other features of
ante-bellum journalism; and, the funny
men becoming alarmed, a general convention
of the order was promptly called
and as quickly assembled.</p>

<p>At this gathering of the comic writers
various means whereby the Young Man
of Talent should be destroyed were discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be better,&#8221; said a hoary and
solemn humorist, whose calling was indicated
by a cane made in imitation of a
length of stovepipe, with a handle of
goat&#8217;s horn, &#8220;much better, I think, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
were to prevail upon him to enter Society
as a literary celebrity, and make a practice
of attending kettledrums and receptions,
where he will be encouraged by
women to talk about his literary methods,
and where he will be tempted to partake
of the tea and cake and weak punch
which have ruined so many brilliant
careers. If, in addition to that, we can
arrange with the Society reporters to
publish his name among &#8216;the well-known
literary and artistic people present&#8217; as
often as possible, his descent will be swift
and sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing necessary to make
that combination invincible,&#8221; said a paragrapher
whose sound logic and conservatism
had long since gained for him the
name of &#8220;The Sage of Schoharie&#8221;: &#8220;we
must call the attention of somebody like
Mr. Aldrich or Mr. Howells to his work,
and induce him to express a favorable
opinion of it. If Mr. Aldrich would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
say that he has a &#8216;dainty style,&#8217; or if Mr.
Howells would praise him for his &#8216;subtle
delineation of character,&#8217; his book, which
is coming out in a few weeks, would fall
flat on the market. Then, if he showed
any signs of life after that, Edmund Gosse
might administer the <i>coup de grâce</i> with a
favorable review in some English fortnightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>These measures having received the indorsement
of every member of the union,
it was resolved that they should be
promptly carried through; but before the
meeting adjourned the Professional Humorist
arose and begged to be allowed to
say a few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the
course we have decided upon will result
in driving this newcomer from the field
of letters; but if it does not I have a plan
in my head which has never failed yet.
It has already, within my own memory,
driven several of our most promising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
writers to the Potter&#8217;s Field, and if desperate
measures become necessary we will
try it, but only as a last resort.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A year rolled by, and again the members
of the union assembled for their
annual convention.</p>

<p>As they passed through Fourteenth
Street on their way to the hall of meeting,
a sad-eyed, despondent figure stood
on the sidewalk and endeavored to sell
them lead-pencils at their own price. A
smile of triumph lit up the face of the
Professional Humorist as he directed the
attention of his fellow-members to the
mournful, ill-clad wretch on the curb-stone.
&#8220;I told you my scheme would
work,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was even so. Neither the kettledrums
nor the commendations of the
wiseacres of literature had had any effect
on the Young Man of Talent, who had
gone steadily on with his work, unspoiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
by feminine flattery, and heedless of the
praise or commendations of the critics.</p>

<p>It was only when these attempts upon
his reputation and popularity had failed
that the Professional Humorist threw
himself into the breach with a paragraph&mdash;which
was given instant and wide publicity
by the rest of the Association&mdash;stating
that the gifted young writer was
<i>the Dickens of America</i>.</p>

<p>And then the Young Man of Talent
tottered to his fall.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE SOCIETY REPORTER&#8217;S
CHRISTMAS</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> morn in the little parlor of a
humble white cottage, where Susan Swallowtail
sat waiting for her husband to
return from the ball. It lacked but a few
days of Christmas, and she had arisen with
her little ones at five o&#8217;clock in order that
William, her husband, might have a warm
breakfast and a loving greeting on his return
after his long night&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Seated before the fire, with her sewing
on her lap, Susan Swallowtail&#8217;s thoughts
went back to the days when William, then
on the threshold of his career as a Society
reporter, had first won her young heart by
his description of her costume at the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the &#8220;Ladies&#8217; Daughters&#8217; Association of
the Ninth Ward.&#8221; She remembered how
gallantly and tenderly he had wooed her
through the columns of the four weekly
and Sunday papers in which he conducted
the &#8220;Fashion Chit-chat&#8221; columns, and
then the tears filled her eyes as memory
brought once more before her the terrible
night when William came to the house
and asked her father, the stern old house
and sign painter, for his daughter&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Susan to herself, &#8220;my
life has not been altogether an unhappy
one in spite of our poverty. William has
a kind heart, and I am sure that if he had
anything to wear besides his dress-suit
and flannel dressing-gown he would often
brighten my lot by taking me out somewhere
in the daytime. Ah, if papa would
only relent! But I fear he will never
forgive me for my marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the
sound of familiar footsteps in the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and the next moment her husband had
clasped her in his arms, while the children
clung to his ulster and clamored for their
early morning kiss.</p>

<p>But there was a cloud on the young
husband&#8217;s brow and a tremor on his lips
as he said, &#8220;Run away now, little ones;
papa and mama have something to say
to each other that little ears must not
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling,&#8221; he said, as soon as they
were alone, &#8220;I fear that our Christmas
will not be a very merry one. You know
how we always depend on the ball of
the Gilt-edged Coterie for our Christmas
dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do,&#8221; replied the young wife,
with a bright smile: &#8220;what beautiful
slices of roast beef and magnificent mince-pies
you always bring home from that
ball! Surely they will give their entertainment
on Christmas eve this year as
they always have?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;can you bear to hear it,
my own love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me know the worst,&#8221; said the
young wife, bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said William, hoarsely, &#8220;I will
tell you. I am not going to that ball.
The city editor is going to take the assignment
himself, and I must go to a
literary and artistic gathering, where
there will be nothing but tea and recitations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Susan, bitterly, &#8220;and sandwiches
so thin that they can be used to
watch the eclipse of the sun. But what
have you brought back with you now?
I hope it is something nourishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling,&#8221; replied William Swallowtail,
in faltering tones, &#8220;I fear you are
doomed to another disappointment. I
have done my best to-night, but this is all
I could get my hands on;&#8221; and with these
words he drew from the pockets of his
heavy woolen ulster a paper bag filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
with wine jelly, a box of <i>marrons glacés</i>,
and two pint bottles of champagne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; said Susan, reproachfully.
&#8220;The children have had nothing to eat
since yesterday morning except <i>pâtés de
foie gras</i>, macaroons, and hothouse grapes.
All day long they have been crying for
corned-beef sandwiches, and I have had
none to give them. You told me, William,
when we parted in the early evening,
that you were going to a house where
there would be at least ham, and perhaps
bottled beer, and now you return to me
with this paltry package of jelly and that
very sweet wine. I hope, William&#8221;&mdash;and
a cold, hard look of suspicion crept into
her face&mdash;&#8220;that you have not forgotten
your vows and given to another&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Susan!&#8221; cried William Swallowtail,
&#8220;how can you speak or even think of
such a thing, when you know full well
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Susan withdrew from his embrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
and asked in bitter, cold accents, &#8220;Was
there ham at that reception or was there
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was ham, and corned beef too.
I will not deny it; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, William, with what woman have
you shared it?&#8221; demanded the young wife,
drawing herself up to her full height, and
fixing her dark, flashing eyes full upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Susan, I implore you, listen to me,
and do not judge me too harshly. There
<i>was</i> ham, but there were several German
noblemen there too&mdash;Baron Sneeze of
the Austrian legation, Count Pretzel, and
a dozen more. The smell of meat inflamed
them, and I fought my way through
them in time to save only this from the
wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew from his ulster-pocket something
done up in a piece of paper, and
handed it to his wife. She opened the
package and saw that it contained what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
looked like a long piece of very highly
polished ivory. Then her face softened,
her lips trembled, and her eyes brimmed
over with tears. &#8220;Forgive me, William,
for my unjust suspicions,&#8221; she exclaimed,
as she threw herself once more into his
arms. &#8220;This mute ham-bone tells me far
more strongly than any words of yours
could the story of the Society reporter&#8217;s
awful struggle for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>William kissed his young wife affectionately,
and then sat down to the breakfast
which she had prepared for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; she said, cheerfully, as she
took a dish of lobster salad from the oven,
where it had been warmed over, &#8220;that
you will keep a sharp lookout for quail
this week. It would be nice to have one
or two for our Christmas dinner. Of
course we cannot afford corned beef and
cabbage like those rich people whom you
call by their first names when you write
about them in the Sunday papers; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
do hope we will not be obliged to put up
with cakes and pastry and such wretched
stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quail!&#8221; exclaimed her husband; &#8220;they
are so scarce and shy this winter that we
are obliged to take setter-dogs with us to
the entertainments at which they are
served. But I will do my best, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as William had gone to bed
Susan took from its hiding-place the
present which she had prepared for her
husband, and proceeded to sew it to the
inside of his ulster as a Christmas surprise
for him. She sighed to think that
it was the best she could afford this year.
It was a useful rather than an ornamental
gift&mdash;a simple rubber pocket, made from
a piece of an old mackintosh, and intended
for William to carry soup in.</p>

<p>But Susan had a bright, hopeful spirit,
and a smile soon smoothed the furrows
from her face as she murmured, &#8220;How
nice it will be when William comes home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
with his new pocket filled with nice,
warm, nourishing bouillon!&#8221; and then she
glanced up from her work and saw that
her daughter, little golden-haired Eva,
had entered the room and was looking at
her out of her great, truthful, deep-blue
eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Christmas eve, and as Jacob
Scaffold trudged through the frosty
streets the keen air brought a ruddy
glow to his cheeks and tipped his nose
with a brighter carmine than any that he
used in the practice of his art. Entering
the hall in which the ball of the Gilt-edged
Coterie was taking place, the proud
old house and sign painter quickly divested
himself of his outer wraps and made
his way to the committee-room.</p>

<p>Then, adorned with a huge badge and
streamer, he strolled out to greet his
friends, who were making merry on the
polished floor of the ball-room. But although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the band played its most stirring
measures and the lights gleamed on arms
and necks of dazzling whiteness, old Jacob
Scaffold sighed deeply as he seated himself
in a rather obscure corner and allowed
his eyes to roam about the room as if in
search of some familiar face.</p>

<p>The fact was that the haughty, purse-proud
old man was thinking of another
Christmas eve ten years before when his
daughter Susan had danced at this same
ball, the brightest, the prettiest, and the
most sought-after girl on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think,&#8221; said the old man to
himself, &#8220;that, with all the opportunities
she had to make a good match, she should
have taken up with that reporter in the
shiny dress-suit! It&#8217;s five years since I&#8217;ve
heard anything of her, but of late I&#8217;ve
been thinking that maybe I was too harsh
with her, and perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the
arrival of a servant, who told him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
some one desired to see him in the committee-room.
On reaching that apartment
he found a little girl of perhaps
eight years of age, plainly clad, and carrying
a basket in her hand. Fixing her
eyes on Jacob Scaffold, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, sir, are you the chairman of
the press committee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied the puzzled artist; &#8220;but
who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the reporter of the <i>Sunday Guff</i>.
My papa has charge of the &#8216;What the
Four Hundred are Doing&#8217; column, but to-night
he is obliged to attend a chromo-literary
reception, where there will be
nothing to eat but tea and cake. Papa
has reported your balls and chowder excursions
for the past five years, and we
have always had ham for dessert for a
week afterward. We had all been looking
forward to your Christmas-eve ball,
and when papa told us that he would
have to go to the tea and cake place to-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
mama felt so badly that I took
papa&#8217;s ticket out of his pocket when he
was asleep and came here myself. Papa
has a thick ulster, full of nice big pockets,
that he puts on when he goes out to report,
but I have brought a basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child finished her simple and affecting
narrative, and the members of the
press committee looked at one another
dumfounded. Jacob Scaffold was the
first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is your name, little child?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eva Swallowtail,&#8221; she answered, as
she turned a pair of trusting, innocent
blue eyes full upon him.</p>

<p>The old man grew pale and his lips
trembled as he gathered his grandchild
in his arms. The other members of the
committee softly left the room, for they
all knew the story of Susan Scaffold&#8217;s
<i>mésalliance</i> and her father&#8217;s bitter feelings
toward her and her husband.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Jacob Scaffold, &#8220;my
grandchild wanting bread? Come to me,
little one, and we&#8217;ll see what can be done
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And putting on his heavy ulster he
took little Eva by the hand and led the
way to the great thoroughfare, on which
the stores were still open.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a happy family party that sat
down to dinner in William Swallowtail&#8217;s
humble home that bright Christmas day,
and well did the little ones enjoy the
treat which their generous new-found
grandparent provided for them. They
began with a soup made of wine jelly,
and ended with a delicious dessert of
corned-beef sandwiches and large German
pickles; and then, when they could
eat no more, and not even a pork pie could
tempt their appetites, Grandpa Scaffold
told his daughter that he was willing to
lift his son-in-law from the hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
ill-paid labor of writing Society chronicles,
and give him a chance to better
himself with a whitewash brush. &#8220;And,&#8221;
continued the old man, &#8220;if I see that he
possesses true artistic talent, I will some
day give him a chance at the side of a
house.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE DYING GAG.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an affecting scene on the
stage of a New York theatre the other
night&mdash;a scene invisible to the audience
and not down on the bills, but one far
more touching and pathetic than anything
enacted before the footlights that
night, although it was a minstrel company
that gave the entertainment.</p>

<p>It was a wild, blustering night, and the
wind howled mournfully around the street-corners,
blinding the pedestrians with the
clouds of dust that it caught up from the
gutters and hurled into their faces.</p>

<p>Old man Sweeny, the stage doorkeeper,
dozing in his little glazed box, was awakened
by a sudden gust that banged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
stage door and then went howling along
the corridor, almost extinguishing the
gas-jets and making the minstrels shiver
in their dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you here to-night?&#8221; exclaimed
old man Sweeny as a frail figure muffled
up in a huge ulster staggered through the
doorway and stood leaning against the
wall, trying to catch his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I felt that I couldn&#8217;t stay away
from the footlights to-night. They tell
me I&#8217;m old and worn out and had better
take a rest, but I&#8217;ll go on till I drop;&#8221;
and with a hollow cough the Old Gag
plodded slowly down the dim and drafty
corridor, and sank wearily on a sofa in
the big dressing-room, where the other
Gags and Conundrums were awaiting
their cues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old fellow!&#8221; said one of them,
sadly, &#8220;he can&#8217;t hold out much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought not to go on except at
matinées,&#8221; replied another veteran, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
was standing in front of the mirror trimming
his long, silvery beard; and just
then an attendant came in with several
basins of gruel, and the old Jests tucked
napkins under their chins and sat down
to partake of a little nourishment before
going on.</p>

<p>The bell tinkled and the entertainment
began. One after another the Jokes and
Conundrums heard their cues, went on,
and returned to the dressing-room; for
they all had to go on again in the after-piece.
The house was crowded to the
dome, and there was scarcely a dry eye
in the vast audience as one after another
of the old Quips and Jests that had been
treasured household words in many a
family came on and then disappeared to
make room for others of their kind.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on the whisper
ran through the theatre that the Old Gag
was going on that night&mdash;perhaps for
the last time; and many an eye grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
dim, many a pulse beat quicker at the
thought of listening once more to that
hoary Jest, about whose head were clustered
so many sacred memories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Old Gag was sitting in
his corner of the dressing-room, his head
bowed on his breast, his gruel untasted
on the tray before him. The other Gags
came and went, but he heeded them not.
His thoughts were far away. He was
dreaming of old days, of his early struggles
for fame, and of his friends and
companions of years ago. &#8220;Where are
they now?&#8221; he asked himself, sadly.
&#8220;Some are wanderers on the face of the
earth, in comic operas. Two of them
found ignoble graves in the &#8216;Tourists&#8217;&#8217;
company. Others are sleeping beneath
the daisies in Harper&#8217;s &#8216;Editor&#8217;s Drawer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re called, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Old Gag awoke from his reverie,
and started to his feet with something
of the old-time fire flashing in his eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Throwing aside his heavy ulster, he staggered
to the entrance and stood there
patiently waiting for his cue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hardly strong enough to go on
to-night,&#8221; said a Merry Jest, touching him
kindly on the arm; but the gray-bearded
one shook him off, saying hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let be! let be! I must read those
old lines once more&mdash;it may be for the
last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now a solemn hush fell upon the
vast audience as a sad-faced minstrel uttered
in tear-compelling accents the most
pathetic words in all the literature of
minstrelsy:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you say, Mr. Johnson, that all
the people on the ship were perishing of
hunger, and yet you were eating fried
eggs. How do you account for that?&#8221;</p>

<p>For one moment a deathlike silence
prevailed. Then the Old Gag stepped
forward and in clear, ringing tones replied:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>&#8220;The ship lay to, and I got one.&#8221;</p>

<p>A wild, heart-rending sob came from
the audience and relieved the tension as
the Old Gag staggered back into the entrance
and fell into the friendly arms that
were waiting to receive him.</p>

<p>Sobbing Conundrums bore him to a
couch in the dressing-room. Weeping
Jokes strove in vain to bring back the
spark of life to his inanimate form. But
all to no avail.</p>

<p>The Old Gag was dead.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">&#8220;ONLY A TYPE-WRITER.&#8221;</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>Cave of the experienced</i> <span class="smcap">Manager</span>
<i>in the centre of a labyrinth under the stage</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager</span> (<i>to energetic young</i> <span class="smcap">Dramatist</span>
<i>who has tracked him to his lair</i>). Yes,
young feller, I&#8217;ve read your play, and,
while it&#8217;s first-class in its way, it ain&#8217;t
exactly what I want. Now you seem to
be a pushing, active sort of a feller&mdash;if
you hadn&#8217;t been you never would have
found your way in here&mdash;and if you can
only get me up the sort of piece I want
we can do a little business together. In
writing a play you&#8217;ve got to bear one
thing in mind, and that is to adapt yourself
to the public taste and the resources
of the theatre. Are you on?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><span class="smcap">Dramatist.</span> Certainly, sir; and I shall
be only too happy to write something
especially for your theatre. I think I can
do it if I only get a chance. Sardou is
my model.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Well, Sardou is all right
enough in his way, but I&#8217;m looking after
something entirely different. Now I want
a strong melodrama, and I&#8217;m going to call
it <i>Only a Type-writer; or, The Pulse of
the Great Metropolis</i>. There are twenty
thousand type-writers in the city, and
they&#8217;ll all want to see it, and each of them
will fetch her mother or her feller along
with her. Then they&#8217;ll gabble about it
to all the people they know&mdash;nothing like
a lot of women to advertise a piece&mdash;and
if there&#8217;s any go in the play at all it&#8217;ll be
talked about from Harlem to the Battery
before it&#8217;s been on the boards a week.
Now, of course, there&#8217;s got to be a moral;
in fact, you&#8217;ve got to come out pretty
d&mdash;d strong with your moral. My idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
is this: In the first act you show the
type-writer&mdash;whose folks are all gilt-edged
people and &#8217;way up&mdash;in an elegant
cottage at Newport. She&#8217;s a light-hearted,
innocent girl in a white muslin dress with
a blue sash. I&#8217;m going to cast Pearl
Livingston for the part, and she&#8217;s always
crazy to make up for an innocent girl.
Recollect you can&#8217;t spread the innocence
and simplicity on too thick. Livingston
wants to say a prayer with her hair hanging
down her back, so if you can ring
that in somehow it&#8217;ll be all the better.
You must give her a good entrance, too,
or she&#8217;ll kick like a steer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dramatist.</span> Excuse me, but I don&#8217;t see
exactly how a type-writer could live in a
Newport cottage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> I&#8217;m coming to that right
away. You see this act is just to show
her as a light-hearted, innocent girl
whose father has always been loaded up
with dust, so she&#8217;s never known what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
was to holler for a sealskin sack and not
get it. But in the end of the act the
father goes broke and exclaims, &#8220;Merciful
heavens, we are beggars!&#8221; and drops
dead. His wife gives a shriek, and all
the society people rush on from the wings
so as to make a picture at the back, while
the daughter&mdash;that&#8217;s Livingston, you
know&mdash;takes the centre of the stage and
says, &#8220;No, mother&#8221;&mdash;or &#8220;mommer&#8221; would
sound more affectionate, maybe&mdash;&#8220;No,
mommer,&#8221; she says, &#8220;not beggars yet, for
I will work for you!&#8221; Curtain! Are
you on to the idea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dramatist.</span> Well, I believe I understand
your scheme so far. But who&#8217;s
the hero, and where do you get your
comedy element?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Oh, the comedy is easy
enough to manage, and as for the hero,
I forgot to tell you that he shows up in
the first act and wants to marry her, but
she gives him the bounce because he&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
poor as a crow. Better make him an artist
or something of that sort. It might
be a good idea to have him a reporter,
and then he can read some good strong
lines about the dignity of his profession
or something of that sort, just so as to
catch on with the press boys. Well, the
next act shows the girl living in a garret
in New York, supporting herself and her
mother by type-writing. Lay it on thick
about their being poor and industrious
and all that, and have some good lines
about the noble working-girl or the virtuous
type-writer or something of that
sort. Livingston&#8217;s got an elegant new
silk gown that she says she&#8217;s going to
wear in that act, so you&#8217;ll have to give
her a few lines to explain that although
they&#8217;re poor she still has that dress and
won&#8217;t part with it because her father
gave it to her, and so she wears it at
home nights when the other one&#8217;s in the
wash.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><span class="smcap">Dramatist.</span> Excuse me, but isn&#8217;t it
rather strange for a poor type-writer to
appear in a handsome new silk dress when
she&#8217;s having hard work to support herself
and her mother? Why not put her in a
plain gingham gown&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manager.</span> Plain gingham be blowed!
Say, young feller, when you know that
cat Livingston as well as I do, you won&#8217;t
sit here talking about plain gingham
gowns. No, siree; she won&#8217;t touch any
part unless she can dress it right up to
the handle. Well, this act is in two
scenes. The first is a front scene showing
the humble house on the virtuous-poverty
plan, with the old lady warming
her bands at a little fire and saying, &#8220;Oh,
it is bitter cold to-night, and the wind
cuts like a knife.&#8221; And then we can have
the wind whistling through the garret in
a melancholy sort of way. The next
scene shows a broker&#8217;s office where the
type-writer is employed. Here you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
run in a little comedy and show them
having a lot of fun while the old man is
out at lunch. Livingston&#8217;s got some first-rate
music&mdash;sort of pathetic-like&mdash;and
you can write some words to it for her to
sing. Write something appropriate, such
as, &#8220;I&#8217;m only a working-girl, but I&#8217;m virtuous,
noble, and true.&#8221; How does that
sound, hey? Well, in this act her employer
insults her, and she leaves him,
though she hasn&#8217;t a cent in the world and
doesn&#8217;t know where to go. You must
give her a good strong scene, and have
the curtain fall on a tableau of indignant
virtue rebuking the tempter. You must
have a picture there that we can use on a
three-sheet poster. In the next act we
have the grand climax. The villain still
pursues her to her new place, for she gets
a job with the aid of the poor young
lover who was bounced in the first act.
Just as the old villain is about to seize
her and carry her off by main force, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
young lover rushes in and knocks him out
with a fire shovel. He falls and breaks
his skull. In comes the doctor&mdash;the lover
goes to fetch him&mdash;and meanwhile the
type-writer gives him some pious talk and
converts him. Maybe it would be a good
idea to ring in the prayer in this act.
Livingston&#8217;s dead stuck on having it in
the piece. Well, he repents of his wickedness,
and when the doctor says he has
only ten minutes to live he says, &#8220;Oh, if
I but had the time I would make a will
and leave all my wealth to this noble girl;
but there is not time enough to write it.&#8221;
And then Livingston says, &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter with my doing it on my faithful
type-writing machine?&#8221; or words to that
effect. So she takes it down like lightning,
and he has just time to sign it
before he expires. Now, young feller,
you&#8217;ve got my idea of a play. You go to
work and write something on that basis;
and mind you don&#8217;t forget what I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
about Livingston&#8217;s prayer and silk dress,
but don&#8217;t work &#8217;em both in in the same act.
Fetch it around to me and maybe we can
do business. Do you want to tackle the
job?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dramatist</span> (<i>dubiously</i>). I&#8217;ll try, sir,
but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a little out of my line.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CULTURE BUBBLE IN
OURTOWN.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> must know, in the first place, that
I am a resident of the thriving city of
Ourtown, where for twenty years past I
have held the position of librarian in the
town library&mdash;a place which has, of course,
brought me into contact with the most
intellectual circles of society, and has won
for me general recognition as the leader
of literary and artistic thought in my
native city.</p>

<p>Last winter I returned to Ourtown
after a six months&#8217; absence, and found to
my dismay that the social life of the
place was altered almost beyond recognition.
&#8220;And is the Coasting Club still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
flourishing?&#8221; I inquired, eagerly, for there
was a foot of snow on the ground, and
my memory went back to the jolly moonlight
slides that we used to enjoy on the
North Hill, and the late suppers of fried
oysters, beer, cheese, and even hot mince-pie
which had no terrors for us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Coasting Club!&#8221; retorts Mrs. Jack
Symple, to whom my remark was addressed;
&#8220;mercy, no! We haven&#8217;t even
<i>thought</i> of coasting this winter. As for
me, I&#8217;ve been so interested in the Saturday
Night Club that I haven&#8217;t had a
moment&#8217;s time for anything else. Oh,
you&#8217;ll be surprised when you see how
much more cultured the town is now than
it was when you went away! You never
hear anything now about skating or coasting
or sleigh-rides or doings of that sort.
It&#8217;s all Ibsen and Browning and Tolstoï
and pre-Raphaelite art and Emerson
nowadays, and Professor Gnowital says
that there&#8217;s as much real culture in Ourtown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in proportion to the number of inhabitants,
as there is in Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>My eyes dilated as Mrs. Symple rattled
off this jargon about the intellectual
growth of Ourtown. A year ago I had
regarded her as a young woman with
brain-cells of the most primitive form
imaginable, picking up pebbles on the
shores of the Shakespeare class; and here
she was drinking deep draughts of advanced
thought, and talking about Ibsen
and Tolstoï and Emerson as glibly as if
they were old acquaintances.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is Professor Gnowital?&#8221; I
asked, &#8220;and by what formula does he estimate
the comparative degrees of culture
to the square foot in Boston and Ourtown?
He must be a man of remarkable
gifts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remarkable gifts!&#8221; echoed Mrs. Symple,
&#8220;well, I should think so. He comes
from Boston and he&#8217;s been giving readings
here before the Saturday Night Club.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
And oh, you <i>must</i> come and make an
address at the meeting next week! It&#8217;s
to be the grand gala one of the whole
course. Professor Gnowital is coming on
to attend it with some really cultivated
people from Boston, and you&#8217;ll be surprised
to see what a fine literary society
there is here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed to address the Saturday Night
Club, but I saw with deep sorrow that the
town had simply gone mad over what it
termed &#8220;culture.&#8221; People whom I had
always regarded as but little better than
half-wits were gravely uttering opinions
about Carlyle and Emerson, or &#8220;doing&#8221;
German literature through the medium of
English translations. And all this idiocy
in place of the Shakespeare Club, sleigh-rides,
late suppers, and coasting, that
once made life so delightful for us all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Symple had asked me to address
the club on whatever topic I might select,
and while I was considering the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
a great idea took possession of my
brain. To think was to act; and without
a moment&#8217;s delay I sat down and wrote a
long letter to my old friend, Dr. Paulejeune,
begging him to come up and address
the club in my stead, and by so
doing render a service not only to his
lifelong friend, but to the great cause of
enlightenment and human progress as
well.</p>

<p>Now Dr. Paulejeune is not only an
educated man with the thinking habit
long fastened upon him, but also that
<i>rara avis</i>, a Frenchman who thoroughly
understands the language, literature, and
social structure of America. Moreover
he possesses in a marked degree the patriotism,
wit, and cynicism of his race,
and has a few hearty prejudices against
certain modern vogues in art which are
remote from the accepted ideals of the
Latin race. Happily enough his name
was well known in Ourtown by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of his little volume of essays, which had
just then made its appearance.</p>

<p>Our town society never gathered in
stronger force than it did on the evening
of the Saturday Night Club meeting at
the Assembly Rooms. At half-past eight
the president of the club introduced the
first speaker, Mr. W. Brindle Fantail, a
young man who made himself conspicuous
in Boston a few years ago by means
of Browning readings, which he conducted
with a brazen effrontery that
compelled the unwilling admiration of
his rivals. In the words of Jack Symple,
&#8220;He caught the Browning boom on the
rise and worked it for all it was worth.&#8221;
Mr. Fantail advanced to the edge of the
platform, ran a large flabby hand through
his dank shock of light hair, and then announced
as his subject, &#8220;Tolstoï, the
Modern Homer.&#8221; Then, with that calm
self-possession which has carried him unharmed
through many a dreary monologue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
or reading, he told his hearers what
a great man Tolstoï was, and how grateful
they ought to be for an opportunity
to learn of his many excellences. Of
course he did not put it quite as broadly
as that, but that was the gist of his remarks.
He told us, moreover, that the
whole range of English literature contained
no such work of fiction as <i>Sevastopol</i>,
and that no writer of modern times
excelled&mdash;or even equaled&mdash;this Russian
Homer. &#8220;In short,&#8221; he said, impressively,
&#8220;Tolstoï is distinctly epoch-making.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next speaker was the illustrious
Professor Gnowital, who declared that
Ourtown would never experience any
genuine intellectual development unless
a thorough study of the fantastic romances
of Hoffmann was begun at once.
I cannot imagine what started the professor
off on that tack unless it was a
desire to choose a subject of which his
hearers knew absolutely nothing. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
words had a great effect, however, for
very few members of the club had ever
heard of Hoffmann, and it had never occurred
to these that his ghostly tales were
at all in the line of that modern culture
which they all adored.</p>

<p>The next speaker was Mrs. Measel,
whose career I have watched with feelings
of mingled respect and amazement.
Mrs. Measel has taught art in a dozen
towns, lectured on the Great Unknowable
in at least two of the large cities, and
given &#8220;Mornings with Montaigne,&#8221; &#8220;Babblings
from Browning,&#8221; and &#8220;Studies
from Stepniak,&#8221; in whatever place she
could obtain a hearing. On this occasion
she talked about the renaissance of something
or other, I&#8217;ve forgotten exactly
what&mdash;and, by the way, there is no better
word for use in culture circles than
renaissance, and that, too, whether you
can pronounce it or not&mdash;well, she began
with her renaissance, but very soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
branched off into a dissertation on Tolstoï
and Ibsen and a few more &#8220;epoch-making&#8221;
people with whose names she
happened to be familiar. I remember
she said that <i>The Doll&#8217;s House</i> was one
of the grandest plays of modern times,
whereat Dr. Paulejeune, who had listened
to everything up to this point without
turning a hair, smiled broadly. On the
whole Mrs. Measel&#8217;s was a good shallow
talk for good shallow people, and I am sure
she made a delightful impression on us all.</p>

<p>Then, at a signal from the president,
Dr. Paulejeune made his way to the platform
and delivered an address which I am
sure will never be forgotten by those who
heard it. It was a daring speech for any
one to make, and particularly so for a
stranger, and that it proved effective in a
far higher degree than either of us had
ever expected was due to the tact, scholarship,
subtlety, and sincerity of my distinguished
friend, Dr. Émile Paulejeune.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>The doctor began with a graceful tribute
to the eloquence, wit, and scholarship
of the speakers who had preceded him,
and then went on to say that he had
chosen as the subject of his discourse
one of the greatest writers of fiction that
the world has ever known&mdash;Daniel De Foe.</p>

<p>There was hearty applause at this, and
some scratching of heads and obvious
efforts on the part of certain guests to
remember who De Foe was and what he
had written. I could not help turning
in my chair to take a look at Mrs. Symple.
The poor little woman was leaning forward
with an expression of absolute
dismay on her silly face. I could read
her thoughts plainly: &#8220;Oh dear, this new
doctor has been and gone and dragged up
another man for me to read about, and
I&#8217;m sure if I get one more book into my
head it&#8217;ll crowd some other one out!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the look of dismay changed to one
of blank, open-mouthed amazement, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
was shared by a large number of the
guests, as Dr. Paulejeune continued impressively:
&#8220;And the book which I have
come prepared to speak of is <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the doctor took up, each in its
turn, the writings and writers whom we
had heard commended by the previous
speakers. &#8220;Tolstoï is all very well,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;if you happen to be fond of Russian
pessimism, and are not fortunate
enough to be familiar with classic English
literature, which contains hundreds
of stronger, better-drawn pictures than
<i>Sevastopol</i>.&#8221; He dismissed Hoffmann
from the discussion with the contemptuous
remark that he was &#8220;simply a
Dutch Poe, and very Dutch at that.&#8221; In
speaking of Ibsen he threw his audience
into convulsions of laughter by gravely
comparing <i>The Doll&#8217;s House</i> with Jacob
Abbott&#8217;s <i>Rollo Learning to Work</i>, a book
which he assured us not only surpassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Ibsen&#8217;s masterpiece in the simplicity and
directness of its style, but abounded in
dramatic situations that were as thrilling
as any that the Northern writer had ever
devised. &#8220;For instance,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there
is a chapter in that estimable little Rollo
book which tells us how the hero was
making a woodpile, and, disregarding the
sound counsel of the conservative Jonas,
insisted upon piling the sticks of wood
with the small ends out and the large
ends inside against the wall of the woodshed.
Do any of you, my friends, recall
the scene of the heap toppling over? It
is portrayed in Mr. Abbott&#8217;s most realistic
style, and is in itself an ideal Ibsen
climax.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he exclaimed, advancing
to the edge of the platform and shaking
a long, bony forefinger at his auditors,
&#8220;do you know&mdash;you who call this
Scandinavian a dramatist&mdash;that perhaps
the most thrilling dramatic situation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
all literature is found here in this book,
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>? If you want to know
what a dramatic situation is, read Daniel
De Foe&#8217;s account of Crusoe finding the
human footprint on the shore of his desert
island. And then read the whole
book carefully through and enjoy its
vivid descriptions, its superb English, its
philosophy, and the great lessons which
it teaches. And when you have finished
it ask yourselves if any man ever obtained
as complete a mastery of the
magic, beautiful art of story-telling as
did Daniel De Foe!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the doctor finished his address
he was greeted with thunders of applause,
while Fantail, Gnowital, and Mrs. Measel
sat dazed at this sudden attack on their
stronghold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven for a little plain, ordinary
sense at last,&#8221; was the way in
which some one expressed the common
sentiment of the club.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>&#8220;And to think,&#8221; chattered Mrs. Symple,
&#8220;that we were cultivated all along
and didn&#8217;t know it! Why, I read the
Rollo books and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> when I
was a child, and never dreamt that they
were artistic or literary or that sort of
thing. I thought they were just stories.
The idea of our paying a dollar apiece
for Mrs. Measel&#8217;s lectures, and muddling
our heads with Ibsen and Tolstoï and the
rest of them that Professor Gnowital told
us were so grand, while all the time we
were really cultured and didn&#8217;t know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The result of my friend&#8217;s lecture was
that within a week we were sliding downhill
and enjoying ourselves in the old
way, and in less than a fortnight the prophets
of culture had departed in search of
fresh pastures.</p>

<p>I do hope, however, that Mrs. Measel
will succeed, for she deserves to if ever a
woman did. She has educated two children
on the profits&mdash;or rather the spoils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
&mdash;of the Browning craze, and has made
Tolstoï pay for the care of an invalid
sister. She gives more culture for the
money than any one in the business, and
I can heartily commend her to any club
or community that feels a yearning for
the Unknowable.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SOME THOUGHTS ON THE CONSTRUCTION
AND PRESERVATION
OF JOKES.</h3></div>


<h3>I.&mdash;THE &#8220;JOKAL CALENDAR.&#8221;</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> joke has its appropriate season.
The true humorist&mdash;one who finds comedy
in everything&mdash;gathers his ideas
from what goes on about him, and by a
subtle alchemy of his own distils from
them jokes suitable to the changing
seasons. The only laws to which childhood
willingly yields obedience are those
unwritten statutes which compel the
proper observance of &#8220;trap-time,&#8221; &#8220;kite-time,&#8221;
and &#8220;marble-time.&#8221; So even must
the humorist recognize the different
periods allotted respectively to goats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
stovepipes, ice-cream, and other foundations
of merriment.</p>

<p>The <i>Jokal Calendar</i> begins in the early
summer, when girls are leading young
men into ice-cream saloons, and keepers
of summer resorts are preparing new
swindles for their guests. Soon the
farmer will gather in his crop of summer
boarders; the city fisherman will entangle
his patent flies in the branches of
lofty trees, while the country lad catches
all the trout with a worm. Then the
irate father and the bulldog will drive the
lover from the front gate, while married
men who remain in the city during their
wives&#8217; absence play poker until early
morn and take grass-widows to Coney
Island. About this time the chronicler
of humor goes into the country, whence
he will return in the early fall with a
fresh stock of ideas, gathered in the village
store, at the farm-house table, and
by the shores of the sounding sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Beginning his autumn labors with the
scent of the hay-fields in his nostrils, and
the swaying boughs of the pine forest
still whispering in his ears, the humorist
offers a few dainty paragraphs on the
simple joys of rural life. The farmer
who dines in his shirt-sleeves, the antiquity
of the spring fowl, the translucent
milk, and the saline qualities of the pork
which grace the table; the city man who
essays to milk the cow, and the country
deacon who has been &#8220;daown to York&#8221;&mdash;all
these are sketched with vivid pen for
the delectation of his readers. But it
must be remembered that these subjects
have been used during the whole summer;
and the humorist, after his return
to the city, can offer, at the best, but an
aftermath of farm-house fun. If it be a
late fall the public may slide along on
banana and orange peel jokes until the
first cold snap warns housekeepers of
the necessity of putting up stovepipes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
(<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;About this time print paragraph
of gas-company charging a man
for gas while his house was closed for the
summer. Allusions to the extortions of
gas-companies are always welcome.)</p>

<p>Stovepipe jokes must be touched upon
lightly, for the annual spring house-cleaning
will bring the pipes down again, six
months later, to the accompaniment of
cold dinners, itinerant pails of hot soap-suds,
and other miseries incident to that
domestic event.</p>

<p>And now that the family stovepipe has
ceased to exude smoke at every joint and
pore, the humorist finds himself fairly
equipped for his year&#8217;s work. The boys
are at school; lodge-meetings have begun,
and sleepless wives are waiting for
their truant lords; college graduates are
seeking positions in newspaper offices
(and sometimes getting and keeping
them, though it won&#8217;t do to let the public
know it); election is at hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
candidates are kissing babies and setting
up the drinks for their constituents;
young men of slender means are laying
pipes for thicker clothes&mdash;in short, a
man must be dull of wit who cannot find
food for comic paragraphs in what goes
on about him at this fruitful season.
The ripening of the chestnut-burr, and
the harvesting of its fruit&mdash;beautifully
symbolical of the humorist&#8217;s vocation&mdash;form
another admirable topic at this time.</p>

<p>Winter comes with its snow and ice,
and the small boy, who is always around,
moulds the one into balls for destructive
warfare, while corpulent gentlemen and
pedestrians bearing eggs and other fragile
articles slip and fall on the other. Oyster-stews,
and girls who pine for them;
the female craving for matinee tickets,
and the high hats which obstruct the view
of those in the back seats; nocturnal
revelry in saloon and ball-room; low-necked
dresses; and the extortionate idleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
of the plumber now keep the pen
of the comic writer constantly at work.
Chapters on the pawning, borrowing,
lending, and renovation of the dress-coat
are also timely.</p>

<p>Spring brings the perennial spring poet
with his rejected manuscript; the actor
with his winter&#8217;s ulster; the health-giving
bock-beer; and, above all, the goat, in the
delineation of whose pranks and follies
the <i>Jokal Calendar</i> reaches its climax.</p>

<p>What the reindeer is to the Laplander
the goat is to the writer of modern
humor. His whole life is devoted to the
service of the paragraphist. He eats
tomato-cans and crinoline; he rends the
theatre-poster from the wall, and consumes
the bucket of paste; he rends the
clothes from the line, and devours the
curtain that flutters in the basement window;
he upsets elderly men, and charges,
with lowered horns, at lone and fear-stricken
women.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>But as the encroachments of civilization
have driven the buffalo from his
native plains, so is the goat, propelled by
a stern city ordinance, slowly but surely
disappearing from the streets and vacant
lots which once knew him so well. He is
making his last stand now in the rocky
fastnesses of Harlem. I have seen him
perched on an inaccessible crag on the
border-land of Morrisania, looking down
with solemn eyes on the great city where
he once roamed careless and free from
can to ash-barrel. Etched against a background
of lowering clouds, his was, indeed,
an impressive figure, the apotheosis
of American humor.</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;THE IDEA AND ITS EMBELLISHMENT.</h3>

<p>In the construction of a joke the chief
requisite is the Idea.</p>

<p>Making jokes without ideas is like
making bricks without straw; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
people who tried that were sent out into
the Wilderness to wander for forty years
and live exclusively on manna and water&mdash;a
diet which is not provocative of
humor. Indeed it is a noteworthy fact
that although the children of Israel were
accompanied in their journeying by herds
of goats, and were constantly hearing
stories of the huge squashes and clusters
of grapes which grew in the Promised
Land&mdash;the California of that period&mdash;yet
we have no record that they availed
themselves of such obvious opportunities
for jesting.</p>

<p>The humorist, having procured his Idea,
should divest it of all superfluities, place
it on the table before him, and then fall
into a reverie as to its possibilities. Let
us suppose, for example, that his Idea, in
a perfectly nude condition, looks something
like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl is thin enough to make a good
match for any one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Now it will not do to offer this simple
statement as a joke. It is merely an Idea,
or the nucleus of a short story, and can
be greatly improved by a little verbiage.</p>

<p>There would be no point gained in
calling the girl a New Yorker, or even a
Philadelphian, though the latter city is
usually fair game for the paragraphist.
She should certainly hail from Boston.
The girls of that city are identified in
the popular mind with eye-glasses, long
words, angularity and other outward and
visible signs of severe mental discipline
and parsimony in diet. The ideal Boston
girl is not rotund. On the contrary, she is
endowed with a sharply defined outline,
and a profile which suggests self-abnegation
in the matter of food. A little dialect
will help the story along amazingly;
therefore let the scene be laid in rural
New England, and let the point be made
with the usual rustic prefix of &#8220;Wa-al!&#8221;
This will afford an opportunity to utilize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
a few minor ideas relative to New England
rural customs, the maintenance of
city boarders, the food provided, the economy
practised, and other salient features
of country life.</p>

<p>So, by judicious expansion&mdash;not padding&mdash;the
humorist will stretch his little
paragraph into a very respectable story,
something like this:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sample of Short Story Erected on Paragraph.</i></p>

<p>A summer evening of exquisite calm
and sweetness. The golden haze of sunset
sheds its soft tints on hill and plain,
and pours a flood of mellow light over
the roofs and trees of the quaint old village
street. The last rays of the sun, falling
through the waving boughs of elm
and maple, form a checkered, ever-moving
pattern on the wall of the meeting-house;
they kindle beacon-fires on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
distant heights of Baldhead Mountain,
and linger in tender caress on the dainty
auburn tresses of Priscilla Whitney, who
is displaying her flounces, furbelows, and
other &#8220;citified fixin&#8217;s&#8221; on the front piazza
of Deacon Pogram&#8217;s residence.</p>

<p>(It will be seen that the beginning of
this paragraph is written in a serious vein;
but the last two lines prepare the reader
for a comic story. He now makes up his
mouth for the laugh which awaits him a
little farther along.)</p>

<p>From the kitchen comes a pleasant
aroma of burnt bread-crusts, as dear
old Samanthy Pogram, her kindly face
covered with its snow-white glory, prepares
the coffee for supper. Meanwhile
the worthy deacon, in stocking-feet and
shirt-sleeves, sits by the open door and
enjoys the cool evening breeze that sweeps
in refreshing gusts down the fertile valley
of the Pockohomock.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ye be again, Sarah,&#8221; says Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Samanthy to the hired help, a shade of
annoyance crossing her fine old face.
&#8220;Hain&#8217;t I told ye time &#8217;n&#8217; again not to
put fresh eggs in the boarders&#8217; omelet?
I suppose ye think there hain&#8217;t such a
thing as a stale egg in the haouse, but
ye must be wastin&#8217; good ones on the city
folks! Sakes alive! but I&#8217;ll be glad when
they&#8217;ve cleaned aout, bag &#8217;n&#8217; baggage.
I&#8217;m nigh tuckered aout a-waitin&#8217; on &#8217;em
&#8217;n&#8217; puttin&#8217; up with their frills &#8217;n&#8217; fancy
doin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me, Samanthy,&#8221; says the
deacon, &#8220;that young Rube Perkins is
kinder makin&#8217; up to one of aour boarders.
I s&#8217;pose ye hain&#8217;t noticed nothin&#8217;, mebbe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him a-settin&#8217; alongside o&#8217;
that dough-faced critter times enough so
he&#8217;d like ter wear aout the rocker on the
piazzy; but I guess Rube had better not
set enny too much store by what <i>she</i> says
to him. Them high-toned Whitney folks
o&#8217; hern daown Bosting way hain&#8217;t over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
&#8217;n&#8217; above anxious to hev Rube Perkins
fur a son-in-law, I kin tell ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; drawls the deacon, reflectively,
&#8220;I kalkerlate they&#8217;ve got an idee she&#8217;d
better make a good match while she&#8217;s
abaout it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s thin enough to make a lucifer
match,&#8221; rejoins Aunt Samanthy; and with
this parting bit of irony she goes in to
put the saleratus biscuit on the tea-table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course this is not a model of a humorous
story, but it will pass muster. It
is, however, a very creditable specimen of
a story built up, as I have shown, on a
very slender foundation. Some humorists
would give it an apologetic title, such
as &#8220;Rural Sarcasm,&#8221; or &#8220;Aunt Samanthy&#8217;s
Little Joke,&#8221; in order to let the
reader down easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.&mdash;REVAMPING OLD JOKES.</h3>

<p>It often happens that the humorist
finds himself unexpectedly called upon
for jokes at a moment when he has no
ideas about him. Perhaps he is away
from his workshop where his tools are
kept, or perhaps he has lost the combination
of the safe in which his precious
ideas are securely locked up. The problem
of how to make bricks without straw,
and the awful fate of the people who attempted
it, stares him in the face. But
his keen intelligence comes to his aid.
Like the trusty guide in Mayne Reid&#8217;s
story, he exclaims, &#8220;Ha, it is the celebrated
joke-root bush, called by the Apaches the
ha-ha plant!&#8221; and seizing an ancient jest,
he tears it from the soil, carefully cleanses
the esculent root from its clinging mould,
and then proceeds to revamp it for modern
use.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>The joke should be one that has slowly
ripened under the suns of distant climes
and other days. It should be perfectly
mellow, and care must be taken to remove
from it all particles of dust and
lichen. Let us suppose, for example, that
the joke, divested of all superfluities, presents
this appearance:</p>

<p>&#8220;A man once gave his friend a very
small cup of very old wine, and the friend
remarked that it was the smallest thing
of its age he had ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have selected this joke because it is
one of the oldest of which the world has
any record.</p>

<p>The world has known many changes
since civilization reached the point that
made old wine an appreciated and acknowledged
delight to the dwellers in the
fertile valley of the Euphrates, and thus
threw open the doors for the appearance
of this joke. The dust of him who gave
and of him who drank the wine are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
blended together in the soil of that once
populous region. Stately sarcophagi
mark the last resting-places of many who
have enjoyed this ancient bit of merriment.
Empires have crumbled since
then; mighty rulers have yielded the insignia
of their power at the imperative
summons of the conqueror of all; yet
nothing has interrupted the stately, solemn
march of this joke along the corridors
of time. It flourished in Byzantium;
it lingered in tender caress on each of the
seven hills of Rome; when Hannibal led
his cohorts across the snow-clad Alps it
stepped out from behind a crag and
said, &#8220;Here we are again!&#8221; And the astonished
warrior recognized it at once, although
it wore a peaked hat and a goitre.</p>

<p>It has awakened laughter among effeminate
and refined Athenians as they lay
stretched in languid and perfumed ease
immediately after the luxurious bath, and
about two hundred years before Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
It has been said that cleanliness is next
to godliness, and yet we find that in this
instance there was room to slip this joke
in between the two, and have two hundred
years of space left.</p>

<p>It is found in the sacred writings of
Confucius, side by side with his memorable
injunction to his followers not to
shed a single cuff or sock unless the ticket
should be forthcoming. Under the iron
crown of Lombardy and the lilies of
France this joke has lived and thrived.
It has even been published in the <i>Philadelphia
Ledger</i> which is a sure proof of
its antiquity.</p>

<p>Surely no one but an American humorist
could look upon this hoary relic without
feelings of veneration. Let us see
what the humorist does with it:</p>

<p>That which has worn a toga in Rome
and a coat of mail in the middle ages, he
now clothes in the habiliments of the
present day. Watch him as he arrays it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
in the high hat, the patent-leather shoes,
the cutaway coat, and the eye-glasses of
modern times, and, behold, we have:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Arthur Cecil, of the Knickerbocker
Club, prides himself on his knowledge
of wines, and boasts of a cellar of
his own which cannot be matched on this
side of the water. Bilkins dined with
him the other night, and as a great treat
his host poured out into a liquor-glass a
few drops of priceless old &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There, my boy,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;you&#8217;ll
not find a drop of that anywhere in New
York except on my table!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bilkins took it down at a single gulp,
smacked his lips, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, old man.
There ain&#8217;t many things lying around
loose that are as old as this and haven&#8217;t
grown any bigger.&#8217;</p>


<p>&#8220;The joke was too good to keep, and
Cecil had to square himself at the club
by ordering up a basket of Mumm.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;THE OBVIOUS JOKE.</h3>

<p>A large class of simple-minded people
believe that the obvious joke is the most
delightful form of humor. An obvious
joke is one whose point or climax can be
seen from the very start, and is, in fact,
a natural sequence to the beginning.</p>

<p>For example, when we begin to read
of a city dude who professed to understand
the distinctively rural art of milking
a cow, and volunteered to show his
friends how to do it, we know perfectly
well that he is going to get knocked out
in the attempt, and that the story will
end in a humorous description of the indignities
inflicted upon him by the enraged
animal. The only chance for variety
in the sketch lies in the manner in
which the cow will resent the dude&#8217;s impertinence.
She may impale him on one
or both of her horns; she may hurl him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
on a dunghill and dance on his prostrate
form; she may content herself with kicking
him; but whatever she does she will
be sure to upset the milk-pail and excite
the laughter of the lover of obvious humor.
Of course a professional humorist
never reads an obvious joke. He knows
exactly what is going to happen the moment
his eye falls on the first paragraph.</p>

<p>If a tatterdemalion appears at the
county fair with a broken-down plug
which he offers to trot against any horse
on the track, the professional humorist
knows that the decrepit charger is going
to win the race, and that his owner will
go away with his pockets bulging out
with the money he has won from the too
confiding.</p>

<p>If a man holding four aces is persistently
raised by a gentleman of quiet demeanor
and bland, childlike face, we can
call the latter&#8217;s hand without looking at
it, because we know from long familiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
with American humorous literature,
as well as poker, that he holds a straight
flush. Some writers have had the effrontery
to deal him a royal flush, forgetting
that he has already given his opponent
all the aces.</p>

<p>If a gentleman of apparently delicate
physique resents the impertinence of a
bully who is forcing his attentions upon
a lady, we know, without reading to the
end of the chapter, that the man of effeminate
build is in reality a prize-fighter
or a college athlete, and will bundle the
bully out on the sidewalk with great rapidity.</p>

<p>The professional humorist shuns these
&#8220;comics&#8221; as he would the plague. They
make him tired. He knows how easy
they are to construct. Moreover he despises
alike the mind that gives them
birth and that which finds them funny.</p>

<p>The recipe for their concoction is very
simple:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>Think of some acquaintance who habitually
eats sugar on his lettuce and
sweetens his claret. The man who says,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want none of this <i>I</i>-talian caterwaulin&#8217;.
The good old-fashioned tunes,
like &#8216;Silver Threads among the Gold,&#8217;
suit me right down to the ground. I
don&#8217;t want none of yer fancy gimcracks
&#8217;n&#8217; kickshaws in mine.&#8221; Try to remember
the sort of thing that has moved this
man to laughter, and then fashion a joke
on the same plan, taking pains to make
it apparent to the most primitive intellect.</p>

<p>Persons of this description are found
in large numbers in the rural districts,
and, therefore, any story tending to cast
ridicule on the city man who puts on airs,
or, in other words, affects the amenities of
civilized life, is sure to be appreciated.</p>

<p>For example: It is the delight of
sportsmen to fish for trout with fly-rods
and tackle of an elaborate description, to
the intense amusement of the yokel who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
catches fish, not for sport, but in order
that he may sell them at an exorbitant
price to some ignorant stranger. Now it
is a very easy matter to compose a story
on this basis suited to the comprehension
of such a rustic.</p>

<p>The following is a fair specimen of a
story of the class I have described:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a real sportsman, just from
the city, and he had come down into the
country to show the benighted inhabitants
how to catch fish. He had a new
patent rod in his right hand and a brand-new
basket over his left shoulder. In his
coat-tail pocket he carried a silver flask,
and in his breast-pocket a big wallet filled
with all the latest devices in newfangled
flies. He walked down the road with the
air of a man who had come to catch fish
and knew just how to do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was growing dark when he returned
to the hotel, wet, muddy, and weary, and
sadly laid aside his implements of sport.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;Fish don&#8217;t bite in this blawsted country,
yer know,&#8217; was his reply to the landlord&#8217;s
cheery inquiry, &#8216;What luck?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And just at this moment who should
come along but old Bill Simons&#8217;s sandy-haired,
freckle-faced boy Jim, with his
birch-pole over his shoulder, and a fine
string of the speckled beauties in his
brown paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good Gawd!&#8217; exclaimed the dude,
&#8216;how did you catch those, me boy?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hook &#8217;n&#8217; line, yer fool! How d&#8217;yer
s&#8217;pose?&#8217; was Jim&#8217;s answer, as he pulled a
handful of angleworms, the last of his
bait, from his pocket, and threw them
out of the window.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">McCLURE&#8217;S MODEL VILLAGE
FOR LITERARY TOILERS.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I paid</span> a visit yesterday to the model
village of Syndicate, founded by Mr. S.
S. McClure for the benefit of the literary
hands employed in his great enterprises,
and I am bound to say that in point of
neatness, order, and the completeness of
its sanitary arrangements it is infinitely
superior to the similar town of Pullman
or any of the colonies established by the
late Baron Hirsch.</p>

<p>It is situated on a bit of rising ground
that overlooks the Hackensack River,
the site having been chosen with a view
to economy and convenience in the shipping
of material by water. The village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
has been in existence a little less than
two years, but it already has a population
of nearly four thousand able-bodied
authors, poets and syndicate hands, together
with their wives and families,
most of whom do their work in the village,
though fully a hundred go each
day to the McClure factory, in Twenty-fifth
Street, returning in the evening in
time to take part in the social life of
the community.</p>

<p>On the banks of the river Mr. McClure
has built a dock and warehouse
for the reception and storage of goods.
Yesterday the scene on the water-front
was an animated one. A bark from
Palestine, manned by the swarthy children
of the East, was discharging its
cargo of photographs of the Holy Land,
reminiscences of the Hebrew patriarchs,
bales of straw garnered by Boaz especially
for the McClure monthly, and
other raw materials to be used in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
literary works. In the offing I saw the
fleet canal-boat <i>Potato Bug</i>, hailing from
Galesburg, Ill., and laden with hitherto
unpublished photographs of Ulysses S.
Grant and recollections of that warrior,
and of his uncles, his aunts, his progenitors,
his progeny, his man-servant, his
maid-servant, his cattle, and the reporter
within his gates.</p>

<p>At the same time a stanch schooner
was receiving its cargo of serials, short
stories, poems, and memoirs, destined for
the New York office. I observed that
the greatest care was exercised by the
men in the work of stowing away the
cargo, the ship having previously been
ballasted with humorous articles and
pungent literary reviews.</p>

<p>I found the village apparently deserted;
only the smoke from the chimneys
showed me that the place was
inhabited. But very soon the noon
whistle blew, and almost immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the streets swarmed with well-fed, cheerful
literary toilers. I was deeply impressed
with the evidences of contentment
and happiness that greeted me on
every side. In the bright faces that
smiled into mine I saw nothing to
remind me of the sullen, low-browed, haggard
literary weavers that one encounters
at the Authors&#8217; Club, or that may
be seen lurking in the doorways of
Union Square, with poems clutched in
their toil-stained hands.</p>

<p>Some of the work is done in the shops
under the supervision of foremen, but
there is a great deal of piece-work given
out and taken by the authors to their
homes. Nearly a hundred hands are
kept constantly busy on the Grant memoirs,
under the careful supervision of
Mr. Hamlin Garland. Near by, working
under glass, I saw half a dozen pallid
young men, all recent discoveries of Mr.
W. D. Howells. The work of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
spring lambs will be placed upon Mr.
McClure&#8217;s counters at an early day.</p>

<p>With Mr. McClure&#8217;s permission I
talked with several of the authors and
questioned them closely in regard to the
wages paid them and the conveniences
and luxuries that the village of Syndicate
affords to its inhabitants. Nearly
every one of these frankly said that he
preferred his life there to the more diverting
existence in the congested sections
of New York. &#8220;And,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;Mr. McClure frequently drafts off a
squad of us for some special work in
New York, and that makes a very pleasant
variety in our lives. We are conveyed
in a small steamboat from here to
the foot of Twenty-fifth Street, and then
transferred to the factory, near Lexington
Avenue, where we work until four
o&#8217;clock, when we are returned in the
same manner. Sometimes, when there
is a great pressure of work on hand, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
cabin of the steamboat is fitted up with
benches and we do piece-work, both
coming and going, thus adding considerably
to our pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock the factory whistle
blew again and the men returned to
their work. Mr. McClure took me
through one of the large buildings and
explained every detail of the work to
me. Every morning the foreman goes
from bench to bench and gives an idea
to each author. Just before noon he
passes along again and carefully examines
the unfinished work, and, late in the
afternoon, a final inspection is made,
after which the goods are packed and
sent down to the wharf for shipment.</p>

<p>I inquired whether there was any
truth in the report that several authors
had been taken with severe illness immediately
after beginning work at Syndicate,
whereupon the foreman explained
that this had happened several times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
but it had always resulted from giving
an author a whole idea all at once&mdash;something
to which very few of them
had ever been accustomed.</p>

<p>I learned, also, that child labor is
strictly prohibited on the McClure property.
This was rather a surprise to me,
for I have been a diligent reader of
&#8220;McClure&#8217;s Magazine&#8221; ever since it was
started. The art department has not
been put into working order yet, but
there is a large blacksmith shop near
the village, which is celebrated for the
inferior quality of its work, and, as its
proprietor and foreman are both drinking,
shiftless men, the place will probably
develop into an art shop, in which
case it will turn out all the pictures for
the magazine and syndicate.</p>

<p>As I was taking my leave, my attention
was drawn to several large oat fields
in the neighborhood of the village, and
I was thereby led to suspect that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
McClure was turning out literature by
horse-power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he said, when I questioned
him on the subject. &#8220;Everything
here is made by hand, but I have
made a contract with a padrone for a
force of Scotch dialect authors, whom I
must feed, clothe, and house while they
are writing for me. I expect them
within a week. I shall put them at
once on a serial called &#8216;Blithe Jockie&#8217;s
Gane Awee,&#8217; which will be my &#8216;feature&#8217;
for the coming year.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">ARRIVAL OF THE SCOTCH AUTHORS
AT McCLURE&#8217;S LITERARY
COLONY.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> morning, at a very early
hour, I was awakened by an imperative
summons from one of the trusty sleuths
that patrol the river-front in the interest
of the paper on which I am employed
and informed that a band of celebrated
literary men had just been landed from
a tramp steamer at a Hoboken pier.</p>

<p>The reticence of actors, singers, authors,
practical evangelists, and female
temperance agitators concerning their
movements renders it necessary for a
great daily paper to maintain a corps of
reliable spies, whose duty it is to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
every incoming steamer and see that
neither Henry Irving nor Steve Brodie
nor Lady Henry Somerset lands unobserved
and unchronicled on our hospitable
shores.</p>

<p>The human ferret who aroused me
from my slumbers declared that the
newly arrived authors were met at the
pier by an active, enthusiastic little man,
who instantly departed with them in the
direction of the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what makes you think that
they were literary men?&#8221; I inquired.
&#8220;Are they entered on the ship&#8217;s papers
as able-bodied authors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw,&#8221; rejoined the sleuth. &#8220;They&#8217;re
beatin&#8217; the contract labor law. I knew
they was authors the minute I seen the
little man that met them at the dock.
He&#8217;s a regular author&#8217;s padrone. He&#8217;s
got a hull town full of &#8217;em back in Jersey
some place. I&#8217;ve known him this
five year or more.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>I waited to hear no more, for I knew
that the active little man could be none
other than McClure; and so I started
without a moment&#8217;s delay for the village
of Syndicate on the banks of the fragrant
Hackensack.</p>

<p>On my way to the station for the authors&#8217;
settlement I met a small boy hurrying
along the dusty highway. I recognized
him as the son of an author
who is now acting as timekeeper of the
Grant memoir gang, and stopped him to
inquire about Mr. McClure.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him a-coming there now, I
think,&#8221; replied the urchin.</p>

<p>I looked in the direction indicated,
and saw what seemed to be a drove of
cattle slowly approaching and enveloped
in a cloud of dust. I sauntered along
to meet them, and in a quarter of an
hour at a sharp turn in the road, I encountered
the strangest literary gathering
that it has ever been my fortune to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
behold; and when I say this I do not
forget that I have frequented some of
the most brilliant literary and artistic
salons that New York has ever known.
At the head of the cavalcade marched
Mr. S. S. McClure, the noted philanthropist,
magazine editor, and founder
of the model village of Syndicate. He
carried a pair of bagpipes under his
arm, and presented such a jaded and
travel-stained appearance that I was involuntarily
reminded of the Wandering
Jew. Behind him marched a band of
strange-looking men, attired in kilts and
wearing broad whiskers, long bristly
hair, and bare knees. A collie dog,
panting and dust-covered, but still sharp-eyed
and vigilant, trotted along beside
them to prevent them from straying
away and losing themselves in the New
Jersey prairies.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. McClure&#8217;s eyes fell
upon me a bright smile lit up his face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and he stopped short in the road, raised
the pipe to his lips, and burst into a triumphant
strain of Scotch music. Those
that followed him paused in their course,
and with one accord began a masterly
saltatorial effort, which, I have since
learned, enjoys great vogue in Glasgow
and Dundee under the name of the
&#8220;Sawbath Fling.&#8221; While they danced
the collie squatted on his hindquarters
and watched them with bright, sleepless
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;McClure,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;in the name of
all that is monthly and serial, what does
this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ford,&#8221; he replied solemnly, as he
advanced and took me by the hand,
&#8220;you know that I have published Lincoln
and Napoleon and Grant and
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Dodge and
Company Ward, but I have something
far greater than all these for the year
1897. Can you not guess the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
of this brave cavalcade that you see before
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Have you actually secured
Professor Garnier&#8217;s &#8216;Equatorial Conversational
Class&#8217; as contributors to your
monthly? That is, indeed, a literary
triumph!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Equatorial nothing,&#8221; retorted the
great editor, testily. &#8220;I have just imported
a herd of blooded Scotch dialect
authors under a one year&#8217;s contract.
We had to walk all the way out from
Hoboken, because I only agreed to pay
their fares to that point, and you know
it&#8217;s thirty cents from there out, and a
Scotchman always likes to walk and see
scenery when he can. The result was
that I had to walk, too, for fear Scribner
or some of those pirates would coax
them away from me, and I swear that if
it hadn&#8217;t been for that dog of mine I
don&#8217;t think I could have got them out
here at all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>At this moment the authors resumed
their march, for they were eager to reach
their journey&#8217;s end, and we followed
behind them, with the faithful collie
trotting contentedly along.</p>

<p>As we walked Mr. McClure continued:
&#8220;We passed through a suburban
town about an hour ago, where
one of those other Scotch authors was
giving a morning lecture, and, before I
knew it, we were in front of the very
church in which he was at work. They
heard him bleating, and there would
have been a regular stampede if it hadn&#8217;t
been for that dog. He had the leader
of them by the throat before you could
say &#8216;bawbee,&#8217; and then he barked and
growled and snapped at them, and finally
chased the whole pack off the church
steps and up the street. I got him of a
firm of Edinboro&#8217; publishers, and I am
going to have a kennel for him in my
New York office and use him in a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
different ways. Look at him now, will
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced around and saw that one of
the authors had contrived to detach himself
from the drove and was leaning over
the fence engrossed in the contemplation
of an advertisement of Glenlivet whiskey,
which had caught his wandering
eye, and as I looked, the dog came hurrying
up from behind, nipped him, with
a snarl of assumed ferocity, in the calf
of his leg, and sent him scampering
back to his place with the others.</p>

<p>We were now entering the principal
thoroughfare of Syndicate, and the authors
looked about in wonder at the silent
streets and long rows of neat white
cottages in which the literary toilers
dwell. From the large brick factory,
where the posthumous works of great
authors are prepared, came the sound of
busy, whirring wheels and the scratching
of steam pens. In the art department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the sledge-hammers were falling
on the anvils in measured cadence&mdash;in
short, everything told the story of
cheerful literary activity. Mr. McClure
threw open the door of a large whitewashed
building, gave the word of command
to the dog, and in less than a
minute the sagacious quadruped had
rounded up the herd of authors and
driven them into their corral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; said the editor as he
closed and bolted the door and turned
to take my outstretched hand. &#8220;Good-by,&#8221;
he continued solemnly, and then
raised his hands above my head. I
took off my hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is the time to subscribe,&#8221; said
Mr. McClure, impressively.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CANNING OF PERISHABLE
LITERATURE.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Saturday</span> is a half holiday at Mr. McClure&#8217;s
village of Syndicate. On that
day the noon whistle means complete
cessation of work, as it always has in
every one of the departments of Mr.
McClure&#8217;s great enterprise.</p>

<p>On the occasion of a recent Saturday
visit to this model settlement I found
scores of well-fed, happy-looking prosers
and poets riding their bicycles up and
down the village street or sitting in rows
on the fence rails eagerly discussing the
condition of the literary market and the
business prospects for the coming year.
In the large playground which lies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the north of the village an exciting game
of football was in progress between two
picked elevens, one selected from the
various &#8220;reminiscence-of-celebrities&#8221;
gangs employed about the works, and
the other made up from the day shift of
&#8220;two-rhyme-to-the-quatrain&#8221; poets.</p>

<p>The Scotch dialect authors were seated
on the piazza in front of their quarters,
mending their shoes, washing their
clothes, and preparing in other ways for
the impending &#8220;Sawbath.&#8221; Mr. McClure
tells me that they are very shy and suspicious,
and refuse to mingle socially with
the other hands. One of them, Dr. Bawbee
MacFudd, was confined to his room
with brain fever, the result of having
been asked to spend something the last
time he went out of the house.</p>

<p>Just beyond the barn devoted to the
Scotchmen Mr. McClure showed me a
building which he erected last spring and
which is now used as a canning factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and warehouse for the storage of perishable
goods.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Mr. McClure, &#8220;we are
doing a very large business here, and
supplying not only my own magazine
and newspaper syndicate with matter,
but also various other publications, which
I cannot name for obvious reasons, so it
frequently happens that we find ourselves
at the close of some holiday season
with a number of poems, stories, or
essays relating to that particular holiday
left on our hands. These &#8216;perishable
goods,&#8217; as we call them in the trade, were
formerly a total loss, but now we can
and preserve them until the holiday
comes round again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. McClure directed my attention to
the wooden shelves which encircled the
main room of the building, and which
contained long rows of neat tin cans and
glass jars, hermetically sealed and appropriately
labelled. In the Thanksgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
department were to be found cans containing
comic turkey dinners in prose
and verse, &#8220;First Thanksgiving in
America&#8221; stories of the old Plymouth
Rock brand so popular in New England,
serious verses designed for &#8220;Woman
and Home&#8221; departments in provincial
newspapers, and other seasonable goods.
Some of these were marked with a red
X, indicating, as Mr. McClure informed
me, that they were of the patent adjustable
brand, made popular throughout
the country by his syndicate, and could
be changed into Christmas goods by
merely altering the name of the holiday.</p>

<p>We were still standing there, when one
of the hands, who seemed to be working
overtime, appeared with a step-ladder,
climbed up to one of the highest
shelves, and brought down three dusty
Washington&#8217;s Birthday jars, which he
opened on the spot. Two were in good
condition, but the third containing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
poem on &#8220;Our Uncrowned King,&#8221; was
found to be in a bad state of preservation
and emitted such a frightful odor that
the workman hastily carried it outside
the building, Mr. McClure and I following
to see what was the matter with it.
The poem was lifted out with a pair of
pincers, and we saw in an instant that
decay had started in the third verse, in
which &#8220;Mount Vernon&#8221; was made to
rhyme with &#8220;burning,&#8221; and had spread
until the whole thing was ruined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very lucky to get off as easily
as this,&#8221; said Mr. McClure, as he noted
the name of the author of the defective
rhyme, &#8220;because it sometimes happens
that these jars containing rotten poetry
explode and do a great deal of damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are our odd lots,&#8221; he explained,
as we continued our tour of inspection.
&#8220;Here are a few cans of
&#8216;Envois&#8217; for use in the repair shops,
and here are a lot of hitherto unpublished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
portraits of people and pictures of
houses and babies and all sorts of things
that have been left over from our serials,
and will come in handy for the Grant
memoirs. Those pictures of the children
of old Zachariah Corncob, who used
to live next door to Lincoln, will do
very well for Benjamin Franklin or
Henry Clay in infancy, and there is that
house that Mr. and Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps Ward used to live in, left over
from a lot of forty that I contracted for
last year; that will look well as the
house that would be occupied by Andrew
Jackson if he were alive now and
lived in Massachusetts. You see, I am
reducing the literary business to a system,
and my plan is to have nothing go
to waste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me, McClure,&#8221; I remarked,
as we left the building, &#8220;that
you have everything here but love
poems; won&#8217;t they bear canning, too?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the great manufacturer,
&#8220;but I have to put them all in
cold storage, even during the winter
months.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">LITERARY LEAVES BY MANACLED
HANDS.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attempt of Warden Sage, of Sing
Sing, to provide literary labor for the
idle convicts has excited so much interest
that yesterday morning a party of
well-known literary men visited the
state prison on invitation of the warden,
and made a careful inspection of the
methods employed in turning out convict-labor
prose and verse.</p>

<p>Some of this work is done in the cells,
and some is carried on in the shops formerly
devoted to the manufacture of
clothing, brushes, shoes, and other articles
turned out under the old contract
system. In the corridors outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
cells and in the shops were to be seen
&#8220;trusties&#8221; going about with dictionaries,
both Webster and rhyming, which they
supplied to any convict who raised his
hand as a signal.</p>

<p>The visitors proceeded down one of
the corridors, and, at the request of the
warden, examined some of the pieces of
manuscript that were passed out to them
through the cell bars. On one tier they
found a squad of short-term men hard at
work on a job intended for the &#8220;Home
and Fireside&#8221; department of a new
weekly. They examined with much
interest a serviceable article called &#8220;How
to Dress Well for Very Little Money,&#8221;
which bore the signature of &#8220;Fairy
Casey,&#8221; and were much pleased with its
style and texture. Mr. Gilder, who was
of the party, and has had long experience
in reading manuscript, was inclined
to criticise the paragraph which stated
that linemen&#8217;s boots could be worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
at all times after dark, but it was explained
to him that that was merely
carelessness on the part of Mr. Casey,
who is a second-story man, and who forgot
he was not writing exclusively for
his own profession.</p>

<p>At the next cell they stopped to look
at an essay called &#8220;Umbrellas and Cake
Baskets, Spoons and Candlesticks, or
How to Make Home Beautiful,&#8221; the
work of &#8220;Slippery Dutch,&#8221; the prominent
sneak thief.</p>

<p>Other specimens of manuscript examined
by the visitors were &#8220;How to Keep
the Feet Warm, or What to Do with
Our Kerosene and Shingles,&#8221; by Mordecai
Slevinsky, the only long-term man
in the gang, and having thirty-seven
years yet to serve; &#8220;Safe Storage for
Negotiable Railroad Bonds,&#8221; by &#8220;Jimmy
the Cracksman,&#8221; and a two-thousand-word
poem in hexameter named &#8220;Throwing
the Scare, or the Chasing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Comeback,&#8221; an extremely creditable job
turned out by Chauncey Throwdown,
formerly a ward detective, who partially
reformed two years ago, and was caught
and sentenced while trying to lead a better
life and earn a more honest living as
a bank thief. Mr. McClure, who was of
the party, was very much pleased with
this poem, and asked permission to buy
it of the convict, saying that it was just
wide enough to fit the pages of his
magazine; but his offer was refused on
the ground that the verses were part of
the job contracted for by the editor of
a new periodical. A slight discussion
on the higher ethics of poetry followed,
to which such of the convicts as were
within earshot listened with deep interest.
Mr. Gilder claimed that the best,
most serviceable, and ornamental poetry
to be had in the market was that which
came in five or six inch lengths, not
counting the title or signature, and bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the well-known &#8220;As One Who&#8221; brand
that the &#8220;Century Magazine&#8221; has done
so much to popularize. Poems of this
description, he explained, are known to
the trade as A1 sonnets, and are very
beautiful when printed directly after a
section of continued story, affording, as
they do, a great relief to tired eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the idea and the
verses should appear on the same
page?&#8221; inquired the warden, who is
eager to learn all that he can of the profession
of letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has not been my practice to print
them in that fashion,&#8221; replied Mr. Gilder,
&#8220;and in my own poems I am always
careful to avoid such a combination,
believing it to be thoroughly inharmonious.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the conversation was
interrupted by the noise of a desperate
struggle at the other end of the tier, and
a moment later four keepers appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
dragging with them one of the most desperate
convicts in the prison. It was
ascertained that he had expressed his
willingness to devote himself to literary
work at the closing of the quarries, but
had requested that the fact should be
kept a secret, as it might be used against
him in after life. He had been furnished
with pen and paper and a pan of
Scotch dialect, but instead of taking
hold with the rest of the gang and working
on his section of the serial story,
&#8220;The Gude Mon o&#8217; Linkumdoodie,&#8221; he
secretly constructed a fine saw and was
caught in the very act of cutting through
the bars of his cell.</p>

<p>The warden, who is a very just man,
rebuked the keepers severely for their
carelessness in putting such temptation
in the way of any prisoner. He bade
them take the offending convict down to
the dark cell and keep him there until
he could find a rhyme for &#8220;sidewalk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>&#8220;And remember,&#8221; he called after
them, &#8220;in future see that no dialect of
any kind is issued to the prisoners until
it is thoroughly boiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The visitors then made their way to
the shops, where they found gangs of
convicts at work under the supervision
of keepers. The prison choir was practising
some new hymns and, at the warden&#8217;s
request, rendered a beautiful new
song composed not long ago by the Rev.
Gideon Shackles, the prison chaplain,
and entitled &#8220;Shall We Gather Up the
River?&#8221;</p>

<p>They had just finished, when the tramp
of heavy feet was heard, and in a moment
there came around the corner a
line of men in prison dress walking,
single file, in lock-step. Under the leadership
of two trusties they made their way
to a long table, seated themselves at it,
and began to write with great diligence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are those men?&#8221; inquired Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
McClure, with some interest. &#8220;I hope
you are not putting any of your gangs
on Washington or Lincoln or Grant this
winter, for that would throw a great many
of my writers out of employment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the warden, &#8220;that is
simply the regular eight-hour shift of
Cuban war correspondents, and very
busy we keep them, too. You see, a
number of newspaper editors are finding
out that we can furnish just as good an
article of Cuban news here in Sing Sing
as they can get from Key West, where
the bulk of the work has been done
heretofore.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and
then Mr. McClure remarked in a very
low voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the names of some
of those fellows down. One of these
days they&#8217;ll be good for reminiscences of
&#8216;How I Freed Cuba,&#8217; or &#8216;The True
Story of the Great Conflict at Our Very
Gates,&#8217; or something of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">McCLURE&#8217;S BIRTHDAY AT SYNDICATE
VILLAGE.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> since the foundation of McClure&#8217;s
model village of Syndicate has
the valley of the Hackensack rung with
such hearty, innocent mirth as it did
yesterday, when McClure&#8217;s birthday was
observed in a fitting manner by the inhabitants
of the literary village. Mr.
McClure, who generously bore the entire
expense of the merrymaking, arrived in
the village nearly a week ago, and since
then has been engrossed in his preparations
for what he declared should be the
most notable literary gathering ever seen
on this continent; and when the factories
closed at six o&#8217;clock on Saturday evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
all the hands were notified that they
would not be opened again until Tuesday
morning, and that the piece-workers
would be paid for Monday as if they
were salaried employees, in order that
the holiday might cost them nothing. It
is by such acts of generosity that Mr.
McClure has made himself beloved by
all literary workers whose good fortune
it has been to do business with him.</p>

<p>And it is because of this and many
other acts of generosity on Mr. McClure&#8217;s
part that that upright and discriminating
manufacturer found no difficulty
in securing a score of willing
volunteers at an early hour on Monday
morning, when it became necessary to
transfer to the lighter <i>Paragraph</i> several
cases of Daniel Webster portraits and a
section of the new Kipling serial for immediate
shipment to New York. This
work accomplished, the hands returned
to the village in time to prepare for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
merrymaking, which began shortly after
one o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>At precisely twelve o&#8217;clock a special
train arrived from New York laden with
invited guests, among whom were a
great many men and women well known
in literary and artistic circles. Mr.
McClure welcomed us cordially as we
alighted at the station, and then led the
way to the art department, where a
toothsome collation had been spread.
The fires had been put out in the forges,
the huge bellows were all motionless,
and the anvils now served to support
the wide boards which were used as a
banqueting table. It was difficult for
me to realize that this well-swept, neatly
garnished room was the smoky, noisy
art department, with fierce flames leaping
from a dozen banks of glowing
coals, that I had visited but a few days
before.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the banquet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
guests were escorted to seats which had
been reserved for them on the village
green, and immediately afterward the
sports began.</p>

<p>The first athletic event was the putting
of the twenty-pound joke from
&#8220;Harper&#8217;s Bazar.&#8221; There were eight
competitors in this contest, including Mr.
Hamlin Garland, who mistook a block
of wood for the joke, threw it, and was
disbarred, as were two other contestants
who were unable to see the jokes after
they had put them.</p>

<p>The next event was an obstacle race
for the cashier&#8217;s window, open to members
of the artistic as well as the literary
section of the settlement, the former
being subjected to a handicap of three
extra &#8220;O. K.&#8217;s&#8221; on account of their superior
sprinting qualities with such a
goal in sight. This contest was won by
a one-legged man, whose infirmity was
offset by the fact of his long experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
in cashier chasing in the office of the
&#8220;Illustrated American.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then came what was called a &#8220;Park
Row contest,&#8221; open to all ex-journalists,
in the form of a collar-and-elbow wrestling
match for the city editor&#8217;s desk,
catch as catch can. There were seven
contestants in this match, each of whom
was obliged to catch all the others in the
act of doing something wrong and report
the same at headquarters. The
prize was given to a gentleman who had
filled every position on the &#8220;Herald&#8221;
from window-cleaner to editor-in-chief,
and is now spending his declining years
at the copy desk in that establishment,
and taking a morose and embittered
view of life.</p>

<p>The running high jump next occupied
the attention of the spectators. A huge
pile of reminiscences of prominent statesmen,
writers, and other famous characters
was placed on the ground, the prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
to be awarded to the author who could
jump over the greatest number of them
without touching the top of the heap.
This proved to be an exceedingly spirited
and interesting contest, and the pile
slowly increased in height until there
was but one contestant left who could
clear it. He proved to be a complete
outsider, the grand-uncle of one of the
poets, who had asked permission to take
part in the sports as a guest of Mr. McClure&#8217;s.
The old gentleman was visibly
affected when the prize was handed to
him, and explained his success by remarking
that for many years he had
been in the habit of skipping all the
reminiscences in &#8220;McClure&#8217;s Magazine&#8221;
whenever he came across them, and this
habit, coupled with his regular mode of
life, had enabled him to lead all his
competitors, even at his advanced age.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilder, of the &#8220;Century Magazine,&#8221;
was kind enough to lend his aid in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
manuscript-throwing contest which followed.
Forty poets, armed to the teeth
with their wares, assailed the &#8220;Century&#8221;
editor with poems, and got them all back
again without an instant&#8217;s delay. The
speed with which the experienced editor
returned each wad of manuscript to its
sender was the subject of general admiring
comment to all present except
the poets themselves, who found themselves
unable to land a single verse. Mr.
Gilder was so fatigued with his efforts
that he asked to be excused from playing
the part of the bag in the bag-punching
contest which the poets were anxious
to have given.</p>

<p>The sports closed with a novel and
interesting game, in which everybody
joined with hearty good-will and enthusiasm.
This game was called &#8220;Chasing
the Greased Publisher.&#8221; An agile Harper,
having been greased from head to
foot, was let loose on the common and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
pursued for twenty minutes by the excited
literary citizens. The skill which
he displayed in eluding his pursuers,
doubling on his tracks and breaking
away from the insecure hold of some
ravenous poet, served to make the contest
the most exciting and enjoyable
event of the whole day&#8217;s programme.
He was finally caught by Mr. Joel Benton,
who floored him with a Thanksgiving
ode, delivered between the eyes.</p>

<p>It was 4:30 o&#8217;clock when the games
closed, and I was compelled to return to
the city without waiting to enjoy the
literary exercises which were held during
the evening.</p>

<p>I had a short conversation with Mr.
McClure, however, and asked him if he
did not find that it paid him to keep his
workmen in good health and spirits the
year round. Mr. McClure replied that he
did, and that he proposed to encourage
all sorts of innocent pastimes&mdash;of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
kind that we had witnessed&mdash;and permit
his literary and artistic hands to enjoy
festivals and merrymakings at frequent
intervals throughout the year.</p>

<p>As the train steamed out of the depot
I heard the inhabitants begin their evening
hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Thou art, McClure, the light, and life</div>

LITERATURE BY PRISON CONTRACT
LABOR.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enforced idleness of state prison
convicts has led some of the large manufacturers
and dealers to seriously consider
the advisability of giving employment
to some of them in the different
branches of their literary establishments.</p>

<p>Mr. Bok recently purchased a quantity
of &#8220;Just Among Ourselves&#8221; goods,
but found them to be inferior in quality
to the samples from which they were
ordered, so he refused to accept them,
and they were subsequently sold at a
reduced rate to Mr. Peter Parley, who is
now editing the Sunday supplement of the
&#8220;New York Times.&#8221; The Harpers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
been more successful, having had more
experience in this peculiar line. It is
an open secret that the ten acres of historical
and other foreign matter contracted
for two or three years ago and
signed with the <i>nom de plume</i> &#8220;Poultney
Bigelow&#8221; are really the work of a gang
of long-term men in the Kings County
Penitentiary, while fully half their
poetry comes from the same institution.</p>

<p>Not long ago, however, the long-termers,
hoping by working overtime to
secure a little money for themselves,
prepared and offered to the proprietors
of the Franklin Square foundry a short
story, which those discerning publishers
were compelled to decline because they
did not like its moral. The story is as
follows, and is called:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="larger">CAFÉ THROWOUT;</span><br />

OR, THE HEY RUBE&#8217;S DREAM.</p>

<p>It was a cold, blustering night in the
very heart of the bitter month of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
and the stranger who entered the
front door of the Café Throwout, on
Sixth Avenue, let in after him a fierce
gust of wind that brought a chill to the
two men who were seated at a table in
the corner, engaged in earnest conversation,
and caused the bartender&mdash;the only
other occupant of the room&mdash;to look up
quickly from the sporting paper which
engrossed his attention and closely scan
the face of the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme a hot apple toddy, an&#8217; put a
little nutmeg on the top of it,&#8221; said the
newcomer as he dropped into an arm-chair
by the stove and stretched out his
hands to catch some of the genial
warmth.</p>

<p>The bartender silently prepared the
drink, and the two men in the corner
continued their conversation, but in lowered
tones and with less eagerness than
before, for both of them were sharply
watching the new arrival. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
strange pair to find in a Tenderloin bar-room,
and it was not easy to conceive of
two men, differing so widely in appearance
and manner, having anything in
common. The elder of the two wore a
black broadcloth suit of clerical cut, deaconish
whiskers of iron-gray, a white
lawn tie, and a mouth so devoid of expression
that its owner was perfectly safe
in exposing it without the precautionary
covering of beard or mustache. His
companion looked as if he might have
come in that very afternoon, in his best
clothes, from some point midway between
Rochester and Elmira. He wore
a checked suit of distinctly provincial
cut, a cloth cap similar to those worn by
rustic milkmen on cold mornings, a
high, turn-down collar, and no cravat,
and, for ornament, a rather conspicuous
bit of jewelry, which might have been an
heirloom known to the family as &#8220;gran&#8217;pa&#8217;s
buzzom pin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>As the bartender handed the hot
drink to the man beside the stove, the
clergyman whispered in a low voice to
his companion, &#8220;I wonder what his
graft is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Graft&mdash;nothing!&#8221; retorted the other;
&#8220;there&#8217;s one of him born every hour&mdash;didn&#8217;t
I tell you? Look at the roll he&#8217;s
flashing up! He handles money as if
he&#8217;d never heard of the Café Throwout
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true. The newcomer, in paying
for his drink, had drawn from his
pocket a large roll of greenbacks, displaying
them as carelessly as if he had
been in a banking house instead of in
one of the most famous resorts for smart
people that the Tenderloin precinct
contains.</p>

<p>Of course by this time the reader has
discovered that the man in clerical garb
and his companion of provincial aspect
were &#8220;smart&#8221; people, each working his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
own particular graft with skill and success.
The faces of both brightened
when their eyes fell upon the newcomer,
who was a sucker of the kind sometimes
sent by a beneficent Providence to his
afflicted people in times of drought.</p>

<p>The elder of the two men was known
to those who contributed to the orphan
asylum that he conducted in Dreamland
as the Rev. William Cassock, but the
workers of the town called him &#8220;Soapy
Sam.&#8221; His companion&#8217;s face adorns the
largest and most interesting gallery of
portraits that the city contains, and is
labelled in the catalogue and explanatory
text-book pertaining to the gallery,
&#8220;Crooked Charlie, the man of many
grafts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two had, indeed, known hard
times since the close of the summer and
were now in no mood to let any stranger
go unscathed. A sudden gleam of intelligence
came into &#8220;Crooked Charlie&#8217;s&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
face, and at the same moment a bright
light gilded the tips of the Rev. William
Cassock&#8217;s iron-gray whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme another o&#8217; them toddies and
don&#8217;t forgit the nutmeg,&#8221; cried the stranger,
and then the two smart people rose
in their places and made a mysterious
signal to the bartender.</p>

<p>As the sucker by the stove slowly
sipped his second drink, the red-hot
iron in front of him changed into the
glowing base of the old wood-burner
that has warmed two generations of
loafers in the little manufacturing town
of Bilkville Centre, Conn. He could
hear the voice of old Hiram Goodsell inviting
him to a game of &#8220;setback&#8221; in
the back room of the tavern, and then
some invisible force bore him up to the
big hall over the schoolhouse, where the
firemen&#8217;s ball was in progress, and he
found himself balancing to corners with
Mirandy Tucker, her that was a Larrabee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>&#8220;Cross over! Cross back! Balance all
and swing your partners!&#8221; chanted old
Bill Cady, and the sucker went swinging
down the room and out into the cold
field and across the snow to the railroad
train which whirled him on to New
York. He was filled with glad anticipations:
he would go to see Lydia
Thompson, he would plunge into the
heart of the gay and beautiful Tenderloin,
where the corks pop merrily all
night long and the ivory chips rattle,
and the music of the banjo and piano
fills the air. Yes, here was New York
at last, and here was the kindly old gentleman,
known affectionately as Grand
Central Pete, who has directed the urban
revels of many a lonely stranger. The
old man welcomes him and explains that
the city pays him to look after unsuspecting
visitors and keep them from
being robbed before they get to Forty-first
Street. Arm in arm, the two bend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
their steps toward what is believed in
the provinces to be the merry quarter of
the town, stopping only at a saloon to
enable the sucker to change a counterfeit
twenty-dollar bill for an obliging
gentleman who hopes he will enjoy his
stay in the city.</p>

<p>They are in the midst of gayety now,
and as he sits there by the stove, unconscious
of where he is, he is living over
again the delights of many memorable
nights in the great metropolis. He
hears the glad strains of the piano, the
merry shouts of feminine laughter, and
sees the whirling skirts and flying feet
of myriad fleet dancers. His throat is
parched and he must have wine, and so
must they all, at his expense. Kindly
faces cluster around him, kind hands
help to pull his money from his pocket,
and, lest he should lose them, his
watch from his fob, his rings from his
fingers, his pin and studs from his shirt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
These are indeed swift passing, merry
hours&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have to wake up, sir; it&#8217;s one o&#8217;clock,
and I&#8217;ve got to close up! Didn&#8217;t you
have a watch-chain on when you came
in here first?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the bartender who has broken
the spell, and the sucker&#8217;s glad dream is
over.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/asterism.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Well, suppose you take the watch,
and I&#8217;ll take the pin and studs, and we&#8217;ll
divide the sleeve buttons,&#8221; says Crooked
Charlie to his companion as the two
enter a saloon a few blocks away from
the Café Throwout.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; rejoins
the Rev. William Cassock as he
stuffs his share of the bills away in an
inside pocket, &#8220;but in the meantime let
us not forget that the same Providence
that caused the manna to fall in the
desert and sent the ravens down to feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Elisha brought this sucker to the Café
Throwout and cast over him the mystic
spell of deep, painless sleep. By the
way, let me compliment you on a certain
detail in your make-up which has attracted
my attention. I notice that you
wear one of those dude collars, without
either cravat or pin. That is in keeping
with your part. A jay would be
content with such a collar, but one of us
would get a cravat and pin first.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">
CHRISTMAS EVE AT THE SYNDICATE
VILLAGE.</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bright morning about six weeks
before Christmas Day the spirit of diligence
in well-doing descended like a dove
and took complete possession of the brain
and soul of Mr. S. S. McClure, the benevolent
founder of the thriving literary
village of Syndicate, which stands on the
banks of the Hackensack River, an enduring
monument to his far-seeing philanthropy.</p>

<p>From that moment he seemed to lose
interest in the great loom-room, where
busy hands made the shuttles fly to and
fro as they wove their reminiscences of
Abraham Lincoln. At midnight, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the foreman opened the furnace door and
the fierce flames lit up the grimy but intellectual
faces of the workmen who stood
watching the <i>History of Our War with
Spain</i>, as it was run into the moulds, Mr.
McClure was not present. His face was
seen no more in the noisy blacksmith-shop,
where strong arms forged the hitherto
unpublished portraits of American statesmen.
Even when a careless workman in
the packing-room dropped a railroad story
and shivered that fragile bit of literary
bric-à-brac into a thousand pieces, the great
Master forgot to reprimand him, so busy
was he with his own thoughts.</p>

<p>But the literary workmen did not take
advantage of the preoccupation of the
great Master Mechanic of all modern
letters and slight the tasks that had been
intrusted to them. On the contrary, they
plunged into their tasks with redoubled
energy, for well they knew that it was
some plan for their happiness that filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the busy mind of the Master, some scheme
for the fitting celebration of Christmas
Eve, which, next to McClure&#8217;s Birthday,
is the chief holiday in the literary calendar.
And so, into the web and woof of
many a <i>Recollection of Daniel Webster</i>
and <i>Later Life of Lincoln</i> were woven
bright anticipations of the merry Christmas
which S. S. McClure was preparing
for his trusty employees.</p>

<p>Each year Mr. McClure devises a new
form of holiday celebration, and this year
his bounty took the shape of a huge Christmas
tree, from whose branches hung the
packages that contained presents for his
guests.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve is always a half-holiday
at the McClure works; and at precisely
noon on Saturday the factory whistle
blew, the great wheels began to slow up,
the dynamos, which furnish light, heat,
and ideas for the entire factory, ceased to
throb, and the cheerful workers put aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
their uncompleted tasks and set about the
welcome labor of making ready for their
Christmas celebration. In less time than it
takes to tell it, the huge store-room, in which
the winter supply of literature had already
begun to accumulate, was swept clean,
garnished with boughs of evergreen, and
brightened with sprigs of holly. Scarcely
had this work been completed when a
shout told of the arrival of the Christmas
tree, drawn by four oxen, on the huge
extension-wagon used in transporting
Scotch serial stories from the foundry to
the steamboat landing. In the twinkling
of an eye, a score of able-bodied bards
seized the great evergreen and placed it
upright in the curtained recess at one end
of the room, and then every one withdrew,
leaving Mr. McClure himself, with four
trustworthy aids, to deck the tree and
hang the presents on its limbs.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the happy littérateurs,
released from their daily toil, threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
themselves heartily into the enjoyment of
all kinds of winter sport. Some put on
skates and sped up and down the frozen
surface of the Hackensack, while others
coasted downhill, threw snowballs at one
another, and even made little sliding-places
on the sidewalk, where they enjoyed themselves
to their hearts&#8217; content. When
twilight fell upon the settlement they all
entered their homes, to emerge half an
hour later clothed in Sunday attire, with
their faces and hands as clean as soap and
water could make them, ready to sit down
to the great Christmas banquet provided
for them by their employer.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if there has ever been as
large a number of literary men seated at
any banquet-table as gathered on this
evening as the guests of Master Mechanic
McClure. The host sat at the upper end
of the great horseshoe table, and beside
him were invited guests representing the
literary profession in its many phases. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
guests were deftly and quickly served by a
corps of one-rhyme-to-the-quatrain poets
who had formerly been contributors to
Mr. Spencer&#8217;s organ of thought, the <i>Illustrated
American</i>, and were thoroughly
accustomed to waiting.</p>

<p>At the close of the feast a huge pie was
placed upon the table, and instantly
opened by Mr. McClure. Thereupon, to
the delight of all the guests, Mr. J. K.
Bangs sprang forth and sang a solemn
and beautiful hallelujah in praise of the
Harper publications.</p>

<p>After the applause which followed this
unexpected encomium of the great publishing-house
had subsided, Mr. McClure
introduced to his employees the literary
centipede, Mr. Harry Thurston Peck, who
stood up in his place, with a pen in each
claw, and explained how it was possible
not only to work with all his tentacles at
once, but also to give the lie to the old
story of the Crow and the Fox, by editing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
a magazine with his teeth, and at the
same time lecturing to the Columbia College
students without letting go of his job.</p>

<p>During Mr. Peck&#8217;s remarks the giver
of the feast quietly withdrew, and, as the
speaker ended, the curtains were withdrawn,
revealing the great, brilliantly
lighted tree, and Mr. McClure himself in
the garb of Santa Claus, ready to distribute
the Christmas gifts. There was
a present for every one, and all had been
chosen with special reference to individual
tastes. To one was given a sled, to
another a pair of skates, to a third a suit
of warm underwear, and to a fourth a
silver-mounted ivory foot-rule for scanning
poetry.</p>

<p>To such of the workmen as held an
unusually high record for a year of industrious
work, not marred by any breakage
of valuable goods, Mr. McClure gave also
an order for some article which could easily
be prepared in odd moments, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
would be liberally paid for when completed
and packed for shipment.</p>

<p>Among the orders thus given were
twelve for plain, hand-sewed, unbleached
Christmas stories for actors, to sign in the
holiday numbers of the dramatic weeklies.
The great annual syndicate article,
&#8220;Christmas in Many Lands,&#8221; was ordered
from the foreman of each department, in
recognition of the high quality of goods
turned out in every part of the shop.</p>

<p>Other literary plums given out for the
picking were &#8220;Christmas Eve on the East
Side,&#8221; &#8220;Christmas at the North Pole,&#8221;
&#8220;Christmas in Patagonia,&#8221; &#8220;Christmas at
the South Pole,&#8221; &#8220;Christmas in the Lunatic
Asylum,&#8221; &#8220;Christmas in the Siberian
Mines,&#8221; &#8220;Christmas with Hall Caine,&#8221; and
&#8220;Christmas in the Condemned Cell.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the delighted guests were opening
their bundles and examining their
presents, the noble-hearted Master Mechanic
stepped forward and announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
that the Christmas prize offered by the
<i>New York Journal</i>, to be competed for by
the inhabitants of Syndicate, had been
awarded to the author of &#8220;Christmas
Inside the Anaconda,&#8221; described by a
<i>Journal</i> representative who got swallowed
on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Santa Claus then announced that there
was still one present to be given, but that
the person for whom it was intended had
been prevented by reason of rheumatism
and other infirmities incidental to old age
from being present. This person, he explained,
was the oldest poet in his employ,
one who had for years innumerable labored
faithfully at bench and lap-stone,
and had been one of the first to find
employment in the now bustling model
village of Syndicate. &#8220;His poems,&#8221; cried
Mr. McClure, warmly, &#8220;lie scattered
throughout the valley of American letters,
from the earliest pages of <i>Petersons&#8217;</i> and
<i>Godey&#8217;s</i> down to the very latest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
<i>Century</i> and <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>. Unlike the distinguished
gentleman who has already
addressed you, he became wedded in early
life to the literary customs of an older
generation, and has never been able to
learn how to write with his feet. For that
reason his output is limited. I am sure
that you will all rejoice with him over a
gift which is designed to make him comfortable
during the rest of his days, and
I call upon a committee of his friends to
bear to his humble home these nice warm
blankets, these thick woolen socks, and
an order to write a weekly article on
&#8216;Books that have Helped Me,&#8217; so long as
the breath remains in his body.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this new instance of generosity on
the part of their beloved employer the
entire company uttered a mighty shout
of approval, and, seizing the gifts from
the hands of Santa Claus, departed in a
body to inform worthy old bedridden
Peleg Scan of his good fortune.</p>
